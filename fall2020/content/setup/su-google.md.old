# Setup Your SU Google Apps Account

All Syracuse University faculty, staff and students recieve a free Google Apps account. The account email address is ***yournetid*@g.syr.edu**. For example my SU Google Apps account is **mafudge@g.syr.edu**. Google makes it easy to be signed into its services such as Drive, Gmail and YouTube with more than one account and allows you to switch easily between then.

In this course we will use Google Forms as a means to take attendance and measure your class participation through answering questions. You will only be able to complete the google forms with your SU Google Apps account.
