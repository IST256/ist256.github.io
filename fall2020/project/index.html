                <h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<h2 id="project-objective">Project Objective</h2>
<p>Your primary objectives for the project are to create something novel, useful and innovative with code. You can draw your inspiration from the many examples given to you throughout the semester. Your project should clearly and explicitly demonstrate the level of programming knowledge that you have acquired in this course.  The type of project you propose is up to you. Ultimately you are evaluated based on not only the idea itself but your execution of it. </p>
<p>Our role is to refine your idea. If it is simple enough we will expect a full implementation, if it&rsquo;s complex then we&rsquo;ll ask for a manifestation of your idea as a minimum viable product. It should be a proof of concept demonstrating how the bigger system might work.  </p>
<p>Higher marks are granted to projects which:</p>
<ul>
<li>are novel, useful and innovative</li>
<li>clearly demonstrate what the team has learned in the course</li>
<li>clearly demonstrate the team is capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently</li>
<li>are extensions / mash ups of existing systems / services rather than just duplications of what exists already.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-guidelines">Project Guidelines</h3>
<p>The project has the following strict guidelines, for logistical / record-keeping purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must work in pairs (teams of 2) drawing from students in your recitation. Teams of 3 accepted only with recitation instructor approval and when there are an odd number of students in the recitation.</li>
<li>You must execute some version of the idea you proposed. If you need to deviate your idea, you must get permission from your evaluator.</li>
<li>Once your idea and team are set they cannot be altered.</li>
<li>All deliverables must be handed in on time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Penalty for not adhering to the guidelines:</strong> grade of ZERO on the project, or that phase of the project, if appropriate. </p>
<h2 id="project-phases">Project Phases</h2>
<p>The project is worth 120 points. These points are divided into 4 phases. Due dates for each phase are posted on the syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-idea-and-team-formation">Phase 1: Idea and Team Formation</h3>
<p>This is formalization of your project idea and team. It is worth 10 points.</p>
<p>You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your group number, as assigned through the Blackboard sign-up sheet.</li>
<li>A list of your team members. You should include times you are available to meet weekly and an agreed upon list of meeting times.</li>
<li>A link to your project github repository.</li>
<li>A summary of your project idea. Think: If I could program anything I would make and why? Think BIG! We understand you might not be able to implement some of your ideas, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you from trying.  Remember to keep the <a href="#project-objective">Project Objectives</a> in consideration. Focus on the problem, not the solution. Don&rsquo;t worry about <strong>how</strong> you will do it, instead focus on <strong>what</strong> you will attempt to do.</li>
<li>Evidence through <strong>research</strong> that your idea is novel / useful / innovative and/or feasible. This ensures you&rsquo;ve thought your idea through. We expect you to provide sources from the web or library.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be assigned a Faculty mentor. Your mentor&rsquo;s role will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide general feedback for your idea.</li>
<li>Use their expertise to help you refine / focus / simplify / improve your project idea.</li>
<li>Provide guidance as to what you should research / learn so that you are in the best position to execute your idea.</li>
<li>Act as your point person for project inquiries for the semester.</li>
<li>Grade your project proposal. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-2-the-project-pitch-proof-of-concept">Phase 2: The Project Pitch / Proof Of Concept</h3>
<p>The Pitch / Proof of Concept is a presentation of your project idea with provide evidence that your project is feasible as proposed by your team. It is worth 30 points.</p>
<p>You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / services / etc. you require to complete your project</li>
<li>Code examples you&rsquo;ve written which demonstrate your team understands how to use these systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / Services / data sets / etc. These should be in your project git repository.</li>
<li>Your program&rsquo;s design: Inputs and Outputs of your program, and a high level algorithm for your program.</li>
<li>We expect the initial feedback provided by your Faculty evaluation was taken into consideration. </li>
<li>A detailed project team work log. This project work log tracks who worked on the project, what was worked on, when it was worked on, and for how long. Each time you contribute to the project it should be recorded in the log.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will provide a 5 minute in-class presentation which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overviews your project idea</li>
<li>Outlines the systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / data sets / services you required to complete the project</li>
<li>Demonstrates, through code, you understand how to use those systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / data sets / services</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Faculty mentor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your project plan and consider it a list of what to expect on demo day.</li>
<li>Grade your project plan and presentation and provide feedback as to maximize your score on the rest of the project.</li>
<li>Your grade is based on the effort to date specific to the code that will help you to complete the project. The farther along you are in your project at this phase the better your grade.</li>
<li>Remember the overall criteria: Is it novel / useful / innovative? It it an an extension / mash up of an existing systems or services rather than just a reproduction of something that exists already? Does it demonstrate the group can acquire new programming knowledge independently?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-3-implementation">Phase 3: Implementation</h3>
<p>Half the project total (60 points) are reserved for your implementation. This consists of the code itself, an updated contribution report, and a reflection.</p>
<p>You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand in all code. This includes the working code and the supporting code you wrote on the way to getting it working. The more code you have which explains how you got from your idea to the final implementation, the better your grade will be.</li>
<li>An updated detailed project team work log, outlining individual&rsquo;s collective efforts to the project.</li>
<li>Each individual team member should include a video reflection, no more than 2 minutes long which succinctly and specifically explains what you learned while completing the project.  Include links to the videos online.</li>
<li>Put all items in a github repository for easy access by your Faculty mentor.</li>
</ul>
<p>How your project implementation will be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there clear code evidence which helps your evaluator determine how you got from original idea to the final implementation? The best means to do this is through routine git commits but you can also use save multiple iterations of your code.</li>
<li>It is expected that your code will execute, be well written in a modular fashion, use aptly named objects, handle errors, and use the programming style you were taught in class.</li>
<li>Is it  novel / useful /innovative? Does the code clearly demonstrate what the team has learned in the course and that they are capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently ?</li>
<li>There is a detailed team contribution report which helps the evaluator gauge the level of effort individually and collectively. Individuals with minimal contributions will receive a lower grade.</li>
<li>Links are included to reflection videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-4-demo-day">Phase 4: Demo Day</h3>
<p>Demo Day is worth 20 points. Demo day is a 120 minute science-fair like project showcase. In addition to the IST256 professors and your classmates, visitors from campus will walk around and ask you to discuss your work and demonstrate your code. It is expected that your team will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and print a poster, no larger than 11x17 which advertises what your program does. The purpose of the poster is to draw passers-by to your project. It is expected your poster will be of professional quality and represent your project&rsquo;s functionality well to non programmers.</li>
<li>Staff your project booth for 60 minutes. During this time, you will answer questions and demonstrate your project. You must get at least 6 visitors to evaluate your project during this time.</li>
<li>Spend 60 minutes visiting and evaluating other project booths. Each individual on your team must evaluate at least 6 other projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to turn in:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Digital copy of your project poster as a PDF or JPG.</li>
<li>A rehearsed video of your demo day presentation, no more than 3-5 minutes. This helps your Faculty evaluator in case they do not see your demo day project.</li>
<li>Your project evaluations and others&rsquo; evaluations of your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must be present at demo day to earn the 20 points. You grade will be based on the artifacts you&rsquo;ve turned in, the number of evaluations your project received from others and the number of projects each of your team members has submitted.</p>
