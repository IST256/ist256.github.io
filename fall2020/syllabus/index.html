<h3 id="quizzes-q1-q4">Quizzes (Q1 - Q4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes evaluate your recall, understanding, and application of the course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations. They are the instrument which measures your mastery.  </li>
<li>There will be four quizzes in the course. Your best three scores count towards your final grade, offering you an opportunity to achieve mastery over the material, should you perform poorly on one quiz.</li>
<li>Despite focusing on specific units, quizzes are naturally cumulative due to the nature of the subject matter.</li>
<li>Quizzes are issued online via blackboard.</li>
<li>You may take the quiz anytime and from anywhere on the quiz date.</li>
<li>Once you start the quiz you must complete it in a single session.</li>
<li>Quizzes are timed at 15 minutes and will auto-submit when time is up.</li>
<li>Questions consist of multiple choice, and fill-in-the blank.</li>
<li>Questions are delivered at random, one question at a time. You cannot revisit questions. This is to avoid cheating.</li>
<li>There are no re-issues or make-ups, since everyone has a 24 hour window to complete the quiz.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-p1-p4">Project (P1 - P4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability as an individual to program something novel, useful and innovative in Python. It should represent the culmination of what you learned in the course.</li>
<li>You will work on the project individually, be expected to produce working code, and be able to explain it at a high level.    </li>
<li>The project is divided into 4 phases; due dates are posted on the course schedule. </li>
<li>Each project phase must be submitted on Blackboard.</li>
<li>Late submissions are accepted but will receive a grade of zero.</li>
<li>Specifics can be found under the <a href="/project">Project</a> heading on the course website.</li>

<h3 id="class-coding-labs-l01-l13">Class Coding Labs (L01 - L13)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each week there will be an out-of-class lab programming activity.</li>
<li>The purpose of the lab is to provide guided, hands-on programming practice. Labs are your first opportunity to get your hands on a keyboard and start programming. </li>
<li>The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the lab you should complete.</li>
<li>You can find the lab activity in your <strong>assignments</strong> folder on JupyterHub.</li>
<li>This activity must be completed and turned submitted by the due date.</li>
<li>You may work alone or with a partner as you complete the lab. If you work with another, you should both complete the lab individually, and you should make a note of who your lab partner was when you completed your work. As to not draw attention to a potential academic integrity violation.</li>
<li>If you are not in attendance at small group you will not receive full credit for the class coding lab as you are not available for discussion. </li>
<li>It is not as important to get the lab correct as it is to ask questions about that which you do not understand about the lab and bring those questions to small group.</li>
<li>Getting it right is secondary to using the lab as an instrument to measure your understanding of the material. Therefore it is important you perform your own self-assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rubric-for-class-coding-labs">Rubric for Class Coding Labs</h4>
<p>Lab Criteria Definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code Complete</strong> means all coding sections have an honest attempt to code the problem at hand. Please note this does not imply the code is correct. If the code is not correct, there is an adequate reflection with student questions. Again, its not about getting it right, but about assessing your comfort level with the material.</li>
<li><strong>Cells Executed</strong> means all code cells in the lab display evidence they were executed in your lab submission.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection Complete</strong> means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab adequately conveying what you have learned and what still confuses you. This should be evident in the work you have done to complete the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Recitation Attendance</strong> means the student was in attendance for recitation, able to discuss the lab.</li>

<h3 id="homework-h01-h13">Homework (H01 - H13)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practice makes perfect. Each week you will be assigned homework to complete outside of class.</li>
<li>The goal of the homework is practice coding independently, on your own. While it is admirable to get the code correct, that is not the evaluation criteria nor is it the purpose of the homework. You should use the homework as a gauge for how well you are grasping the material. </li>
<li>You can find the the homework assignment in your <strong>assignments</strong> folder on JupyterHub. The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the homework assignment you should complete.</li>
<li>Homework are <strong>individual assignments</strong>. You can collaborate on strategy but you must must work alone on the assignment.  You must be able to explain the code you write, or it will be considered an academic integrity violation. It&rsquo;s not about getting it right, but it is about making an honest self-assessment!</li>
<li>If you get assistance from somewhere else, such as online, or someone else such as a tutor, you must divulge that in your submission or it will be considered an academic integrity violation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rubric-for-homework">Rubric for Homework</h4>
<p>Homework Criteria Definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code Attempted</strong> means an honest attempt was made at a solution. This implies the solution is incorrect but the student&rsquo;s reflection narrative provides insight as to this as well.</li>
<li><strong>Code Well Written</strong> means you code is easy to understand, modular in nature, has aptly named variables.</li>
<li><strong>Problem Analysis Complete</strong> problem analysis was complete, identifying the problem&rsquo;s inputs, outputs, and algorithm. An outline of the  step-by-step process for how the program should behave.</li>
<li><strong>Questions Complete</strong> means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection Complete</strong> means the student completed their code reflection, discussing their experiences with completing the assignment. This should provide insight as to how the work was done touching upon struggles, how you got it done, what was learned in the process.  </li>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>No extra credit is offered in this course. </p>
<h3 id="course-honor-code">Course Honor Code</h3>
<p>The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All work is my own</strong>. Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, homework, problem sets, projects, papers, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly permitted). In the case where collaboration is permitted I will only collaborate within my team.</li>
<li><strong>I will not share answers.</strong> I will not make answers (either my own or the professor’s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web or sharing them in test banks.</li>
<li><strong>I will not misrepresent my ability.</strong> I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids and copying homework.</li>
<li><strong>I will give credit.</strong> I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the web, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper.</li>
<li><strong>I accept the honor code and its consequences.</strong> I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University&rsquo;s office of Academic Integrity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sanctions-for-violations-of-academic-integrity">Sanctions for Violations of Academic Integrity</h3>
<ul>
<li>All suspected academic integrity violations will be reported to the university&rsquo;s office of academic integrity.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for violations on homework assignments or labs, is a grade of zero.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for violations on a quiz or the final project is a grade of F in the course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="effort-class-participation-and-attendance">Effort, Class Participation and Attendance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance, class participation and your overall effort may factor into your final grade.</li>
<li>Attendance will be taken and your participation will be measured in both small and large group. We notice students who are attending, being helpful to others, putting in effort, actively participating and those who do not.</li>
<li>The small group instructors have a final say as to whether your final grade will be altered based on your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Students with exemplary effort, attendance or participation may be moved UP one letter grade.</strong>  For example if you finish with A- you might be moved up to an A. Reasons for being moved up are solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. Examples include but are not limited to: perfect attendance, noticeable improvement in grades throughout the semester, being a good mentor / coach to other students by helping in recitations and answering student questions on gitter. </li>
<li><strong>Students with poor effort, attendance or participation may be moved DOWN one letter grade.</strong> For example if you finish with an A-, you might be moved down to a B+. Reasons for being moved down is usually poor attendance (3 or more absences in the semester), but is not limited to only attendance. </li>
<li>If your final grade is adjusted UP or DOWN, you will receive a written notification of justification from an instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Requests to have your grade adjusted will be ignored. Please let your actions speak for themselves.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syracuse-university-policies">Syracuse University Policies</h2>
<p>Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversity and Disability</strong> (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/">https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/</a></li>
<li><strong>Religious Observances Notification and Policy</strong> (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: <a href="http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm">http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm</a></li>
<li><strong>Orange SUccess</strong> (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disability-related-accommodations">Disability-Related Accommodations</h3>
<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in this process.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their website at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">http://disabilityservices.syr.edu</a> Please call (315) 443-4498 or email <a href="mailto:disabilityservices@syr.edu">disabilityservices@syr.edu</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible to begin this process.</p>
<h3 id="university-attendance-policy">University Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.</p>
<p>It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in
Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More
information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a> Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.</p>
<h3 id="discrimination-or-harassment">Discrimination or Harassment</h3>
<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.</p>
<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; by email: <a href="mailto:titleix@syr.edu">titleix@syr.edu</a>; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.</p>
<h3 id="course-evaluations">Course evaluations</h3>
