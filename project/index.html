                <h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<h2 id="project-objective">Project Objective</h2>
<p>Your primary objectives for the project are to create something novel, useful and innovative with code. You can draw your inspiration from the many examples given to you throughout the semester. Your project should clearly and explicitly demonstrate the level of programming knowledge that you have acquired in this course.  The type of project you propose is up to you. Ultimately you are evaluated based on not only the idea itself but your execution of it.</p>
<p>Our role is to refine your idea. If it is simple enough we will expect a full implementation, if it&rsquo;s complex then we&rsquo;ll ask for a manifestation of your idea as a minimum viable product. It should be a proof of concept demonstrating how the bigger system might work. That being said, it is important to engage us. It can only make your project and your grade better.</p>
<p>Higher marks are granted to projects which:</p>
<ul>
<li>are novel, useful and innovative</li>
<li>clearly demonstrate what has been learned in the course</li>
<li>clearly demonstrate you are capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently</li>
<li>are extensions / mash ups of existing systems / services rather than just fabrications of what already exists.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-guidelines">Project Guidelines</h3>
<p>The project has the following strict guidelines, for logistical / record-keeping purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must work alone.</li>
<li>You must execute some version of the idea you proposed. If you need to deviate your idea, you must get permission from your evaluator.</li>
<li>Once your idea is set it should not be altered.</li>
<li>All deliverables must be handed in on time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Penalty for not adhering to the guidelines:</strong> grade of ZERO on the project, or that phase of the project, if appropriate. </p>
<p>When in doubt, TALK TO US.</p>
<h2 id="project-phases">Project Phases</h2>
<p>The project is divided into 4 phases. Due dates for each phase are posted on the syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-idea-p1">Phase 1: Idea  (P1)</h3>
<p>This is formalization of your project idea.  You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>A summary of your project idea, In 250 - 500 words. Think: If I could program anything I would make and why? Think BIG! We understand you might not be able to implement some of your ideas, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you from trying.  Remember to keep the <a href="#project-objective">Project Objectives</a> in consideration. Focus on the problem, not the solution. Don&rsquo;t worry about <strong>how</strong> you will do it, instead focus on <strong>what</strong> you will attempt to do.</li>
<li>Evidence through <strong>research</strong> that your idea is novel / useful / innovative and/or feasible. This ensures you&rsquo;ve thought your idea through. We expect you to provide sources from the web or library to back your research.</li>
<li>Start a <strong>code journal</strong>, recording when you work on your project and summarizing what you did. Every time you work on your project record the date, time, what you did. The most important part of your journal should be the summary. What did you do? Did you finish it? What issues are outstanding? What questions do you have? Did you hit any dead-ends? How did you work around the problem? Are you stuck? What are you stuck on?</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructor&rsquo;s role will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide general feedback for your idea.</li>
<li>Use their expertise to help you refine / focus / simplify / improve your project idea.</li>
<li>Provide guidance as to what you should research / learn so that you are in the best position to execute your idea.</li>
<li>Act as your point person for project inquiries for the semester.</li>
<li>Grade your project proposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-2-the-project-pitch-proof-of-concept-p2">Phase 2: The Project Pitch / Proof Of Concept (P2)</h3>
<p>The Pitch / Proof of Concept is a presentation of your project idea with provide evidence that your project is feasible:</p>
<p>You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>References to the API&rsquo;s / Python packages / services / etc. you require to complete your project and why you need them.</li>
<li>Your program&rsquo;s design: Inputs and Outputs of your program, and a high level algorithm for your program. How will this program interact with the user.</li>
<li>Code examples you&rsquo;ve written which demonstrate you understand how to use these systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / Services / data sets / etc. These should be in your project git repository.</li>
<li>Turn in an updated version of your journal, reflecting the work you&rsquo;ve done.</li>
<li>We expect the initial feedback was taken into consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will provide a brief slideshow presentation which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overviews your project idea</li>
<li>Explains the program flow - hoe it will work.</li>
<li>Outlines the systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / data sets / services you required to complete the project</li>
<li>Demonstrates, through code, you understand how to use those systems / API&rsquo;s / Python packages / data sets / services</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Instructor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your project plan and consider it as what to expect for the implementation phase.</li>
<li>Grade your project plan and presentation and provide feedback as to maximize your score on the rest of the project.</li>
<li>Your grade is based on the effort to date specific to the code that will help you to complete the project. The farther along you are in your project at this phase the better your grade.</li>
<li>Remember the overall criteria: Is it novel / useful / innovative? It it an an extension / mash up of an existing systems or services rather than just a reproduction of something that exists already? Does it demonstrate the group can acquire new programming knowledge independently?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-3-implementation-p3">Phase 3: Implementation (P3)</h3>
<p>Implementation consists of the code itself, and a video reflection.</p>
<p>You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell us where your code is on Jupyterhub. This includes the working code and the supporting code you wrote on the way to getting it working. The more code you have which explains how you got from your idea to the final implementation, the better your grade will be. Basically you can work on Jupyterhub and tell us the folder in which to find your project and how to run it.</li>
<li>Your final copy of your code journal, since the code is now complete.</li>
<li>A Video reflection 1-3 minutes long which covers what you learned from the experience of building your application. Your journal should help. It should touch upon your successes and failures. What you needed to change and why. What would you do differently next time? How would you improve it if you had more time? Upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo or some other video hosting service.</li>
</ul>
<p>How your project implementation will be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there clear code evidence which helps your evaluator determine how you got from original idea to the final implementation? </li>
<li>It is expected that your code will execute, be well written in a modular fashion, use aptly named objects, handle errors, and use the programming style you were taught in class.</li>
<li>Is it  novel / useful /innovative? Does the code clearly demonstrate what the team has learned in the course and that they are capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently ?</li>
<li>There is a detailed team contribution report which helps the evaluator gauge the level of effort individually and collectively. Individuals with minimal contributions will receive a lower grade.</li>
<li>Does your journal adequately reflect upon the work you&rsquo;ve done?</li>
<li>Link to your reflection videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-4-demo-p4">Phase 4: Demo (P4)</h3>
<p>The Demo portion of the project in the elevator pitch and demonstration of your code.  You should rehearse and record your demo and post it do a video service like YouTube or Vimeo. Imagine you are trying to sell the product you made or get people to invest in it. Your pitch should be at a high level and you should not explain lines of code. The demo shows us you understand how your code works and can explain it at a high level.</p>
<p>It is expected that you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a video, under 5 minutes in length, which explains your project and then demonstrates how it works.  Make sure to demonstrate how your code solves the problem you set it out to and demonstrate it handles errors and bad input. You should explain how something works but not get into lines of code. For example you might say, &ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve entered a location, my program is finding the best price on hotels. It does this by searching 4 online service providers.&rdquo;  </li>
