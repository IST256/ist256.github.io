You can draw your inspiration from the many examples given to you throughout the semester. Your project should clearly and explicitly demonstrate the level of programming knowledge that you have acquired in this course. The type of project you propose is up to you. Ultimately you are evaluated based on not only the idea itself but your execution of it. Our role is to refine your idea. If it is simple enough we will expect a full implementation, if it\u2019s complex then we\u2019ll ask for a manifestation of your idea as a minimum viable product. It should be a proof of concept demonstrating how the bigger system might work. Higher marks are granted to projects which: are novel, useful and innovative clearly demonstrate what the team has learned in the course clearly demonstrate the team is capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently are extensions / mash ups of existing systems / services rather than just duplications of what exists already. Project Guidelines The project has the following strict guidelines, for logistical / record-keeping purposes. You must work in pairs (teams of 2) drawing from students in your recitation. Teams of 3 accepted only with recitation instructor approval and when there are an odd number of students in the recitation. You must execute some version of the idea you proposed. If you need to deviate your idea, you must get permission from your evaluator. Once your idea and team are set they cannot be altered. All deliverables must be handed in on time. Penalty for not adhering to the guidelines: grade of ZERO on the project, or that phase of the project, if appropriate. Project Phases The project is worth 120 points. These points are divided into 4 phases. Due dates for each phase are posted on the syllabus. Project Phase Deliverables Points P1 Idea and Team Formation 10 P2 Project Pitch / Proof of Concept 30 P3 Implementation 60 P4 Demo Day 20 Total 120 Phase 1: Idea and Team Formation This is formalization of your project idea and team. It is worth 10 points. You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard: Your group number, as assigned through the Blackboard sign-up sheet. A list of your team members. You should include times you are available to meet weekly and an agreed upon list of meeting times. A link to your project github repository. A summary of your project idea. Think: If I could program anything I would make and why? Think BIG! We understand you might not be able to implement some of your ideas, but don\u2019t let that stop you from trying. Remember to keep the Project Objectives in consideration. Focus on the problem, not the solution. Don\u2019t worry about how you will do it, instead focus on what you will attempt to do. Evidence through research that your idea is novel / useful / innovative and/or feasible. This ensures you\u2019ve thought your idea through. We expect you to provide sources from the web or library. You will be assigned a Faculty mentor. Your mentor\u2019s role will be to: Provide general feedback for your idea. Use their expertise to help you refine / focus / simplify / improve your project idea. Provide guidance as to what you should research / learn so that you are in the best position to execute your idea. Act as your point person for project inquiries for the semester. Grade your project proposal. Phase 2: The Project Pitch / Proof Of Concept The Pitch / Proof of Concept is a presentation of your project idea with provide evidence that your project is feasible as proposed by your team. It is worth 30 points. You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard. A list of systems / API\u2019s / Python packages / services / etc. you require to complete your project Code examples you\u2019ve written which demonstrate your team understands how to use these systems / API\u2019s / Python packages / Services / data sets / etc. These should be in your project git repository. Your program\u2019s design: Inputs and Outputs of your program, and a high level algorithm for your program. We expect the initial feedback provided by your Faculty evaluation was taken into consideration. A detailed project team work log. This project work log tracks who worked on the project, what was worked on, when it was worked on, and for how long. Each time you contribute to the project it should be recorded in the log. You will provide a 5 minute in-class presentation which: Overviews your project idea Outlines the systems / API\u2019s / Python packages / data sets / services you required to complete the project Demonstrates, through code, you understand how to use those systems / API\u2019s / Python packages / data sets / services Your Faculty mentor will: Review your project plan and consider it a list of what to expect on demo day. Grade your project plan and presentation and provide feedback as to maximize your score on the rest of the project. Your grade is based on the effort to date specific to the code that will help you to complete the project. The farther along you are in your project at this phase the better your grade. Remember the overall criteria: Is it novel / useful / innovative? It it an an extension / mash up of an existing systems or services rather than just a reproduction of something that exists already? Does it demonstrate the group can acquire new programming knowledge independently? Phase 3: Implementation Half the project total (60 points) are reserved for your implementation. This consists of the code itself, an updated contribution report, and a reflection. You will hand in the following as per the instructions on Blackboard. Hand in all code. This includes the working code and the supporting code you wrote on the way to getting it working. The more code you have which explains how you got from your idea to the final implementation, the better your grade will be. An updated detailed project team work log, outlining individual\u2019s collective efforts to the project. Each individual team member should include a video reflection, no more than 2 minutes long which succinctly and specifically explains what you learned while completing the project. Include links to the videos online. Put all items in a github repository for easy access by your Faculty mentor. How your project implementation will be evaluated: Is there clear code evidence which helps your evaluator determine how you got from original idea to the final implementation? The best means to do this is through routine git commits but you can also use save multiple iterations of your code. It is expected that your code will execute, be well written in a modular fashion, use aptly named objects, handle errors, and use the programming style you were taught in class. Is it novel / useful /innovative? Does the code clearly demonstrate what the team has learned in the course and that they are capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently ? There is a detailed team contribution report which helps the evaluator gauge the level of effort individually and collectively. Individuals with minimal contributions will receive a lower grade. Links are included to reflection videos. Phase 4: Demo Day Demo Day is worth 20 points. Demo day is a 120 minute science-fair like project showcase. In addition to the IST256 professors and your classmates, visitors from campus will walk around and ask you to discuss your work and demonstrate your code. It is expected that your team will: Create and print a poster, no larger than 11x17 which advertises what your program does. The purpose of the poster is to draw passers-by to your project. It is expected your poster will be of professional quality and represent your project\u2019s functionality well to non programmers. Staff your project booth for 60 minutes. During this time, you will answer questions and demonstrate your project. You must get at least 6 visitors to evaluate your project during this time. Spend 60 minutes visiting and evaluating other project booths. Each individual on your team must evaluate at least 6 other projects. You are expected to turn in: A Digital copy of your project poster as a PDF or JPG. A rehearsed video of your demo day presentation, no more than 3-5 minutes. This helps your Faculty evaluator in case they do not see your demo day project. Your project evaluations and others\u2019 evaluations of your project. You must be present at demo day to earn the 20 points. You grade will be based on the artifacts you\u2019ve turned in, the number of evaluations your project received from others and the number of projects each of your team members has submitted.","title":"Project"},{"location":"project/#project","text":"","title":"Project"},{"location":"project/#project-objective","text":"Your primary objectives for the project are to create something novel, useful and innovative with code.

Methods of Evaluation Requirements This course uses a well thought out mix of individual, group, in-class and out-of-class instruments to assess your knowledge acquisition. A variety of techniques are used to cater to students of different learning styles and assess the course learning outcomes. Assessment Name Blackboard Gradebook Learning Outcomes Quantity Points Each Points Total Exams E1 - E4 1,2,3 4 (3 best count) 100 300 Project P1 - P4 1,2,3,4,5 1 (Split in 4 Phases) 120 120 Zybook Participation Z01 - Z10 1,2,3 10 (all 10 count) 6 60 Class Coding Labs L01 - L13 1,2,3,4 13 (12 best count) 5 60 Homework H01 - H13 1,2,3,4,5 13 (12 best count) 5 60 TOTAL 600 Exams (E1 - E4) Exams evaluate your recall and understanding of the course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations. There will be four exams in the course. Your best three exam scores count towards your final grade, offering you an opportunity to achieve mastery over the material. You must attempt all 4 exams to qualify to have one of your exam scores dropped. Due to the nature of the subject matter, examinations are naturally cumulative. Exams dates are posted on the syllabus class schedule. It is your responsibility to be present for each exam on the date posted. There are no re-issues or make-ups, as this is logistically difficult to accomplish fairly. Exams are issued on paper as multiple choice. You may be asked to write a program by hand. Exams are closed-book. You may not use notes, a computer or any aids (calculator, phone, etc\u2026) Exam dates are posted on the course schedule. All course content is considered for exam questions. Assigned readings, Labs, Lectures, and Homework. Specific Exam Policies Exam dates posted on the class schedule. Exams are issued at the beginning of class and are 30 to 45 minutes long. If you show up late you will receive less time to complete the exam. If you show up after the exam completes, you\u2019ve missed the exam. In general there are NO MAKE UP EXAMS without a university-approved reason such as illness or family emergencies. These must be documented by the university. You may request to take the exam at another time. The request must be made at least 1 week in advance of the exam date. You must have a legitimate reason for this request AND prof. Fudge must approve it. If your exam is approved you will suffer a 50% penalty for not taking the exam on the scheduled date. This is out of inconvenience of scheduling a proctor for the exam. Project (P1 - P4) The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability to program something novel, useful and innovative in Python. The project is divided into 4 phases; due dates are posted on the course schedule. Late submissions are accepted but will receive a grade of zero. The project is a group assignment, teams of no more than 3 people. Details for the project can be found under the Project heading on the course website. Zybook Participation (Z01 - Z10) The Zybook https://learn.zybooks.com/ interactive textbook is an excellent resource for learning Python. As such, your use of this resource will be graded. For most lessons, relevant Zybook chapters are assigned on the course schedule . For each assigned chapter, you are expected to complete the reading and participation activities by 3PM Monday. The Zybook website records your interactions so it is trivial to see how much of the chapter you have completed. Only the readings and participation activities are graded. The challenge activities and labs are optional. Rubric for Zybook Participation Amount of the chapter you\u2019ve completed before deadline Assigned Grade 100% 6 90% or more 5 80% or more 4 70% or more 3 60% or more 2 50% or more 1 Less than 50% 0 Class Coding Labs (L01 - L13) Each week there will be a lab programming activity. You can find the lab activity in your git repository folder. This activity must be completed and turned in between the lecture and recitation sections. It will be discussed in the recitation. You may work alone, but it is not frowned upon to work alongside a partner as you complete the lab. If you work with another, you should both complete the lab individually, and you should make a note of who your lab partner was when you completed your work. You are awarded up to 5 points for the lab. If you are not in attendance at recitation you will not receive full credit for the class coding lab. Students are expected to be present and capable of discussing their lab in recitation. It is not as important to get the lab correct as it is to ask questions about that which you do not understand about the lab and bring those questions to recitation. You are given one \u201cFree Pass\u201d, meaning you have one incomplete lab without penalty. Rubric for Class Coding Labs Lab Criteria Definitions: Code Complete means coding sections have an honest attempt to code the problem at hand. Please note this does not imply the code is correct. If the code is not correct, there is an adequate reflection with student questions. Cells Executed means all code cells in the lab display evidence they were executed in your lab submission. Reflection Complete means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab. Recitation Attendance means the student was in attendance for recitation, able to discuss the lab. Turned in on Time means you must have the lab complete, code committed and pushed to GitHub by 11:59pm the day before your scheduled recitation. Late labs must be turned in no later than Saturday 11:59PM. Lab Criteria Assigned Grade All 5 criteria met 5 One of criteria 1 through 3 is not met. 4 One of criteria 4 through 5 is not met. 3 Two of criteria 1 through 5 is not met. 2 Three of criteria 1 through 5 is not met. 1 Four or more of criteria 1 through 5 is not met. 0 Homework (H01 - H13) Practice makes perfect. Each week you will be assigned homework to complete outside of class. Homework are individual assignments . You can collaborate on strategy but you must must work alone on the assignment. You must be able to explain the code you write, or it will be considered an academic integrity violation. If you get assistance from somewhere else, such as online, or with a tutor, you must divulge that in your submission or it will be considered an academic integrity violation. The homework is due by the end of the week\u2019s lesson. Saturday by 11:59pm. Late homework or homework edited after the due date receives a 0. You are given one \u201cFree Pass\u201d, meaning your lowest homework score is dropped. Rubric for Homework Homework Criteria Definitions: Code Correct means your solution to the assignment is correct, solving the problem at hand. In addition is handles edge cases and bad input when explicitly directed to do so. Code Attempted means an honest attempt was made at a solution. This implies the solution is incorrect but the student\u2019s reflection narrative provides insight as to this as well. Code Well Written means you code is easy to understand, modular in nature, has aptly named variables. Problem Analysis Complete problem analysis was complete, identifying the problem\u2019s inputs, outputs, and algorithm. An outline of the step-by-step process for how the program should behave. Questions Complete means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab. Reflection Complete means the student completed their code reflection, discussing their experiences with completing the assignment. This should provide insight as to how the work was done touching upon struggles, how you got it done, what was learned in the process. Turned in on Time means you must have the lab complete, code committed and pushed to GitHub by Saturday 11:59pm. Homework Criteria Assigned Grade All 7 criteria met 5 Criteria 2 through 7 are met, but code is not correct 4 One of criteria 4 through 6 is not met. 3 One of criteria 1 through 3 AND one of criteria 4 through 6 is not met. 2 Three of any criteria 1 through 6 is not met. 1 Criteria 7 not met OR Four of any criteria 1 through 6 is not met. 0 Grading Scale For Final Grade We use the following grading scale for translating your total points earned into a letter grade to be submitted to the University registrar. Student Achievement Total Points Earned Registrar Grade Grade Points Mastery 570 - 600 A 4.000 540 - 569 A- 3.666 Satisfactory 510 - 539 B+ 3.333 480 - 509 B 3.000 450 - 479 B- 2.666 Low Passing 420 - 449 C+ 2.333 390 - 419 C 2.000 360 - 389 C- 1.666 Unsatisfactory 300 - 359 D 1.000 0 - 299 F 0.000 Course Specific Policies Due Dates Due dates for all assessments are posted in Blackboard https://blackboard.syr.edu . Please consider these dates the official due dates . Due dates are also posted to the IST256 website for reference. In general late work is not accepted. Please get your work in on time so we can get it returned to you in a timely manner. Extra Credit No extra credit is offered in this course. There are enough opportunities to improve your grade through dropped exams, homework, and labs. Make the most of these opportunities! Tutoring We encourage you to attend the free small-group tutoring sessions for IST256 available through the Center for Learning and Student Success (CLASS). Several tutoring sessions for IST256 will be offered each week. The tutors will be trained undergraduate and graduate students who have access to our course information and can help you study efficiently and effectively. Tutoring sessions will be geared to each week\u2019s lessons. Visit http://class.syr.edu to learn when and where sessions meet and how to reserve a spot. You may also drop in if space is available. Course Honor Code The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states: All work is my own . Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, homework, problem sets, projects, papers, etc\u2026) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc\u2026) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly permitted). In the case where collaboration is permitted I will only collaborate within my team. I will not share answers. I will not make answers (either my own or the professor\u2019s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc\u2026) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc\u2026) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web or sharing them in test banks. I will not misrepresent my ability. I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids and copying homework. I will give credit. I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the web, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper. I accept the honor code and its consequences. I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University\u2019s office of Academic Integrity. Sanctions for Violations of Academic Integrity All suspected academic integrity violations will be reported to the university\u2019s office of academic integrity. Sanctions for violations on homework assignments or labs, is a grade of zero. Sanctions for violations on an exam or the final project are F in the course. Effort, Class Participation and Attendance Attendance, class participation and your overall effort may factor into your final grade. While these factors are not actively graded, they are monitored. We notice students who are attending, being helpful to others, putting in effort, actively participating and those who do not. The course instructors have a final say as to whether your final grade will be altered based on your efforts. Students with exemplary effort, attendance or participation may be moved UP one letter grade. For example if you finish with a 565/600 or an A- you might be moved up to an A. Reasons for being moved up are solely at the instructor\u2019s discretion. Examples include but are not limited to: perfect attendance, noticeable improvement in grades throughout the semester, being a good mentor / coach to other students by helping in recitations and answering student questions on gitter. Students with poor effort, attendance or participation may be moved DOWN one letter grade. For example if you finish with a 565/600, or an A-, you might be moved down to a B+. Reasons for being moved down is usually poor attendance (3 or more absences in the semester), but is not limited to only attendance. If your final grade is adjusted UP or DOWN, you will receive a written notification of justification from an instructor. Requests to have your grade adjusted will be ignored. Please let your actions speak for themselves. Syracuse University Policies Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concerns: Diversity and Disability (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/ Religious Observances Notification and Policy (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm Orange SUccess (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at: http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/ Disability-Related Accommodations Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in this process. If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their website at http://disabilityservices.syr.edu Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible to begin this process. University Attendance Policy Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi. It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use \u201cESPR\u201d and \u201cMSPR\u201d in Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/ Students should also review the University\u2019s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester Academic Integrity Policy Syracuse University\u2019s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University\u2019s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. Discrimination or Harassment The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender. Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University\u2019s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu ; or by telephone: 315-443-0211. Course evaluations There will be an end of course evaluation for you to complete this term. This evaluation will be conducted online and is entirely anonymous. You will receive an official notification in your email account with the evaluation website link and your passcode. Please take the time and fill out this evaluation as your feedback and support of this assessment effort is very much appreciated.

Part 1: Overview Becoming a Modern programmer Programming is more than just writing code and solving problems. Modern programming is a collaborative activity. For instance, so many people contribute code to the Linux kernel, the number of contributors is too high to count ! This is why one of the learning objectives of this course is to: \"Understand how to code in teams, collaborate with others and manage source code.\" To do that we need to learn and use the same tools and techniques that actual programmers use. It\u2019s going to steepen our learning curve a bit, but trust us when we say it\u2019s worth it! Remember. Today\u2019s programmers: Use the command line to operate their computer. Use git (or some other source code manager) manage their code. Write code that is easily understood by others Can explain their code to others (including non-programmers) You\u2019ll do each of these, many times throughout this course. You\u2019ll start some of them RIGHT NOW! Goals of this walk-through The goal of this exercise is to get you acquainted with the process of \u201chow we will code\u201d in this class. It DOES NOT focus at all on programming itself. In fact all the code will be written for you. Instead we will focus on the PROCESS of coding. We will cover the tools you will use throughout the course such as the command line / terminal , git , GitHub , and Jupyter Notebook to write our programs, execute them, then commit your work so your others can view it. Upon the completion of this walk-through you should be able to: Locate your Learn-Python code repository on your computer and open the command line in the repository folder. Use Python\u2019s Jupyter Notebook environment. Write and execute a simple Python program. Use git to commit your code changes and push them over the Internet to GitHub. View your code changes on the GitHub website. After you complete this walk-through you should have a good idea how to work on your code in-class and save your work to GitHub. Before You Begin Before you complete this walk-through you should need to make sure you\u2019ve completed the course setup checklist . You cannot complete this walk-through without it! If for some reason you\u2019ve haven\u2019t completed the course setup checklist (ahem\u2026 shame on you!) then you should do so NOW. NOTE: You cannot complete the lab or homework without first following the course setup checklist to set up your laptop. Part 2: The Programming Process [L01] In this part we will guide you through the programming process step-by-step. When you are finished with the process you will have completed your first lab, L01, and handed it in to Github for a grade! In this walk-through we will simulate your typical workflow when working on labs, recitations, or homework assignments in this course. Specifically we will: Open, Edit, and Execute a Python program using Jupyter Notebook Open the command line in our Learn-Python git repository Save our code changes to git , then push them to GitHub View our saved code locally and on the GitHub website. Step 2.1: Open, Edit, and Execute a Python program using Jupyter Notebook The primary tool we will use to program in Python is called Jupyter Notebook . This is the preferred development environment of Scientists, Data Analysts, and of course Data Scientists. The notebook environment is beneficial to these disciplines because you can combine instructions with code and intermix visualizations such as tables, map and graphs. Jupyter runs as a mini web server within the Azure Notebooks environment thus all you\u2019ll need to write and run your code is a web browser. Log on to Azure Notebooks: https://notebooks.azure.com with your SU email and NetID password. From the Azure Notebooks home page select the IST256 project. From the IST256 project page, click the run button (It will probably say \u201cRun on free Compute\u201d). This will launch the Jupyter Notebooks environment. You can tell the environment has launched as you will see \u201cPowered by jupyter\u201d at the top of the page. Next, we have to navigate to our code. We\u2019re in Lesson 01, so we have to find that folder: Click on your Git repository folder. Click on the content folder. Click on the lessons folder. Click on the 01 folder. You should now see the folders pertinent to this lesson: NOTE: There are typically 4 folders per lesson, defined as follows: Watch-Me-Code This folder contains the code demos as part of lecture day. End-To-End-Example This folder contains the end to end examples as part of lecture day. Class-Coding-Lab This folder contains the class coding lab and supporting files. Now-You-Code This folder contains the homework exercises. One will be worked on during recitation, the other must be finished by the end of the week. The code we will write is in the Class-Coding-Lab folder. Double-click on that folder. You should see the file: Files ending with .ipynb are Jupyter Notebook files. Double-click on CCL-walkthrough.ipynb to open the notebook file. Notice this opens a new Tab in your browser window: Let\u2019s write some code! Click on empty cell beneath the text. It should now be outlined in GREEN. Type the following code in the cell: print(\"Hello, Python!\") your screen should look like this: To execute the code from the current cell, press Shift+Enter or press the play button beneath the menu item named \u201cCell\u201d. The code in the cell will execute, and underneath it you will see the output: Jupyter then places you in a new cell where you can write additional code. NOTE: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell that you can find by exploring\u2026 The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a modal editing system. This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard depends on which mode you are in. The two modes are: Edit mode: Indicated by a green border around one cell. Whatever you type appears as is in that cell. This is how you code. Command mode: The green border is replaced by a Blue and grey border. Key strokes are interpreted as commands \u2014 for example, typing l toggles line numbers. To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the Esc keyboard To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit Enter or click in a cell The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it. In this screenshot, I\u2019ve toggle line numbers on for cell with code in it: PRO TIP: Need a list of commands? Open the command pallette from the toolbar. It lists all the available commands! What key do you press to save the notebook? Press it now! Next, Let\u2019s paste in some sample code which really shows off the power of Jupyter notebook. This code, taken from http://matplotlib.org/1.4.1/examples/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar_demo.html will generate a polar chart of random data. Copy and paste the following code into the cell beneath your Hello, Python! program: %matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 20 theta = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False) radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N) width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N) ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True) bars = ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) for r, bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor(plt.cm.jet(r / 10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) plt.show() Don\u2019t worry about what this code is doing right now. You\u2019ll learn to understand it in time! When you paste and execute the code you should see this: NOTE: The chart will be different each time it runs as its based on random data. In this final coding step, we will write code to test your Python setup. Type the following code into a new cell below your chart: We gave you a screen shot of the code this time to force you to type it in! Practice makes perfect! If the code executes correctly, you should see the message This is Working in the program output. Working will be colored green, like this: HELP I GOT ERRORS!!! If you get an ImportError then you will need to go to another cell and import the missing module. For example, if you are missing matplotlib in the cell you would type: !pip3 install --user matplotlib to add the missing bits to Python. Yes there\u2019s a ! character in frot of the command. This instructs Jupyter notebook to drop down to the command line. Exiting Your Jupyter Notebook File So you are done with your Jupyter notebook file, so how do we save and close out? Save your work. Enter command mode and press s to save. Exit the notebook page. From the Jupyter menu select File then Close and Halt : NOTE: It is important to exit the notebook file this way or else it will continue to run in the background. This will slow down other notebooks you attempt to run! Step 2.2: Opening the command line in your Learn-Python git repository. You will need to commit your code changes and send them to GitHub for grading. In order to do this, you must open up the command line (linux terminal) in your git repository folder. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS IN YOUR SLEEP WITH HANDS TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK. From the Azure Notebook homepage https://notebooks.azure.com , select the IST256 project from the My Projects workspace. Click the Terminal icon to launch the terminal. This will give you access to the command line. When the terminal launches you should see a command line with the prompt nbuser@nbserver:~$ Switch the current working directory to the library folder by typing: cd ~/library Your command prompt should now read: nbuser@nbserver:~/library$ Next you need to switch into the local copy of your Git reposiotry folder. This will likely begin with the year and semester you\u2019re taking the course e.g. 2019-fall-learn-python-mafudge-su . For example, I would type: cd 2019-fall-learn-python-mafudge-su . The easiest way to find your folder is to type: cd then type the year you\u2019re taking the course, then press the TAB key and the teriminal will complete the rest for you! Verify you are in the correct folder by typing: git status * If you are in the correct folder, you should see on branch master in the first part of the command output. * If you are NOT in the correct folder, you will see fatal: not a git repository in the first part of the command output. Step 2.3: Save our code changes to git , then push them to GitHub During this walk-through we\u2019ve made changes to the file: CCL-walkthrough.ipynb . Those changes are saved in Azure Notebooks, but how do we share them with our Professor? We\u2019ll walk-through this process next. From the terminal you opened in the previous step: We\u2019ve made some changes, let\u2019s see what git has to say about them. Type: git status to check the state of our repository. The output should look something like this: Git tells us we have changes which are not staged for commit . This means we\u2019ve made changes and git doesn\u2019t know about them yet. You must tell git which changes to files you want to commit. This is called staging the commit. Let\u2019s tell git to stage all the changed files in the repository folder. Type: git add --all 99% of the time this is what we want. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository now that we\u2019ve staged our files. Type: git status again to see what\u2019s happening in our repository. Now git tells us the files we\u2019ve changed are now ready to be committed . Let\u2019s commit the changes to git. What does this mean exactly? Git Commit Explained: When you commit files, you\u2019re saving the history of them to git repository. It\u2019s like taking a snapshot of your repository folders\u2019 contents at that point in time. Because you have this snapshot you are able to revert the files back to this point whenever you desire. As you can imagine, this is an extremely useful feature for programming teams who are making changes (good and bad) to their code. Think of the commit as an insurance policy: You hope you never need to use it, but it\u2019s there for you just in case you do ! Whenever we commit we should should add a message: something to remind us of the changes we\u2019ve made. This is helpful in the event you need to cash in on that insurance policy! Enough talk. Time to commit our changes. Type: git commit -m \"Completed programming walk through lab\" NOTE: The -m represents the message part of the commit. The output says there we 1 files changed, and 56 insertions, meaning we added 56 lines of code since the last commit. Yes, git makes managing your team easy because it tracks not only who worked on what but also quantifies their contributions . Your information may vary slightly, of course. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository files now. Type: git status Now our local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit. This tells us our local git repository is newer than our remote copy on GitHub. We also have nothing to commit meaning our files are in sync with our local copy of git. This makes sense: we just committed! The last step in the process is to sync up our local copy of git commits with on GitHub. Before we do that let\u2019s explain the process. The status message says Your branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit . What exactly does this mean? Well, when we initially cloned the repository off GitHub, it made two versions of the repository. One is still on GitHub (git calls this one \u2018origin/master\u2019 ) the other is on your computer. When the two repositories get out-of-sync, we can reconcile them in two ways: When the the local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a push to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the local commits remotely on GitHub. When the the local branch is behind \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a pull to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the commits on GitHub in our local repository. Since we\u2019re ahead we should push . Type: git push origin master You should see output similar to the following: (again your message might be different depending on what was changed) An one final check of the repository status: Type: git status Which is the same status from the beginning of the walk-through! It tells us nothing has changed locally and what we have here is now in sync with GitHub. IMPORTANT: You\u2019ll execute step 2.3 every time you code . You should get in the habit of following this procedure after each coding session. Class is over? commit code and push to GitHub. Work on your homework for an hour? commit your code and push to GitHub. Not only will it record your changes for you in the event you need to undo a change , but it also backs up your work to the cloud in the event that work has a problem or becomes lost / broken! It\u2019s great insurance against disasters and its so, so easy to do . You can push the same assignment multiple times. We professors will always look as the latest version! Step 2.4: Visualizing your commits on GitHub Once you get rolling with a few commits it might be useful to look back at the history of changes you\u2019ve made. Let\u2019s demonstrate that locally and on GitHub. Open your repository website on https://github.com . If you don\u2019t remember what it is from the command line in your local repository type: git remote -v to display it. From the GitHub repository Website, select commits From the commits page, select the commit for which you would like to view the changes In this example you want to select the commit with message Completed programming walk through lab You will then see a web of all the files changed in that commit. In this example we should see the file CCL-walkthrough.ipynb . On the left is the file before the commit On the right is the file after the commit Github uses the familiar red/green and + / - syntax as gitk Part 3: On Your Own [H01] Next, we will walk you through a typical homework assignment. Since we\u2019ve focused on committing work to with git already, in this part we will emphasize how go about completing homework. Similar to the labs, the homework assignments can be found in your git repository folder and you code the solution in Jupyter notebook. Getting Started Open the following file in Jupyter Notebook: lessons/01/Now-You-Code/NYC1-walkthrough.ipynb This homework assignment is similar to all the others. It consists of several sections: problem definition, problem analysis, section to write code, and some questions which encourage you to think laterally. Each of these sections should be completed before you hand in a homework assignment. At the bottom of the homework is a reminder of how the homework is evaluated. Use this to make sure you\u2019re achieving the highest grade possible for your efforts. Step 1: Problem Analysis Before we can solve a problem with computer code, we must first understand the problem itself . This is an essential and often overlooked aspect of computer programming. Programming provides vast resources at your disposal, but unless you can combine them into a coherent solution they are not much use. A good way to analyze a programming problem is with the input-process-output model. In this model we identify the inputs into the program, the expected outputs based on those inputs and then we write down the steps (the algorithm) to get from input to output. Your algorithm, or steps should NOT be in any programming language. They should be written as atomic steps in a natural language. To become a good algorithm writer takes practice. It seems foreign at first but like anything the more you do it the more natural it becomes. Let\u2019s complete the problem analysis section together: Double click on the Problem analysis section to edit the markdown. When you\u2019re in edit mode it looks like this: Add the following to the markdown, outlining the inputs, output, and process for this program. Again, this is a common problem solving approach. When you are finished press SHIFT+ENTER to execute the cell and save your documentation. NOTE: For more complicated homeworks, you might spend an hour or so just thinking about your approach to the problem. I encourage you to do this \u201coff line.\u201d Most people are better problem solvers without the distractions of music, a computer, or background noise. Give yourself a chance in isolation to think about the problem deeply! You\u2019ll be surprised how productive it can be! Step 2: Write code Now that we\u2019ve outlined the problem and formally laid out a plan for writing the program, we can move on to writing our code. If you\u2019re doing it right, this step is merely taking each line in your algorithm and asking yourself, \u201cHow do I translate this into Python.\u201d When you\u2019re doing it wrong, such as coding without a problem analysis, then this step will be painfully frustrating. Let\u2019s complete the code section together: Next, move into the code cell: And write the Python program: print(\"Python Check Divider\") people = int(input(\"How many people are dining? \")) check_total = float(input(\"What is the total amount of the check? \")) contribution = check_total / people print(\"Each person should contribute\", contribution, \"dollars.\") When you are finished the cell should look like this: Press SHIFT+ENTER to execute the code. Try the same inputs as in the example run at the top. Do you get the same outputs? Execute the program a few more times, trying different inputs and verifying the outputs the program gives you match those you would expect. For example a $20 check split with 2 people should be $10 each. Is it? You\u2019ll have to \u201cplay computer\u201d and figure out the outputs yourself. This is a key activity of good programmers - never \u201cassume\u201d the computer code is correct, \u201cprove\u201d it\u2019s correct! In fact really good programmers write code to prove their code is correct, a process known as automated testing . NOTE: Usually, it will take you several iterations of the previous 2 steps before your program is \u201cdone\u201d. Why? Most problems are non-trivial and you are learning how to become a problem solver. Sometimes you won\u2019t know your original plan is crap until you write code and run it. DO NOT get discouraged by this! Each failure is a lesson which helps us become a better, more experienced programmer. In fact the end result of any working program Facebook to Angry Birds is the culmination of a mountain of failures, dead-ends, and small victories en-route to a feature-complete application. This is what makes programming so frustrating yet gratifying at the same time. Learn to embrace failure and work it to your advantage! Step 3: Questions After you\u2019ve completed the program you should answer the questions in the questions section. These are designed to \u201cget you thinking\u201d about the problem and test the flexibility of your solution. The questions usually focus on edge cases and potential pitfalls students may not have considered as they completed the homework. Completing them offers valuable insight into the program and ways to make it better. Many student go back and improve their program after answering the questions in an effort to score as high as possible on the homework. Edit the Questions cell and provide an answer to each question underneath the question itself. Since every student\u2019s answer will be different I did not include a screenshot this time. You may have to run the program to answer some of the questions. Make sure you click off the question cell and back into the code cell to run the program! NOTE: It is important to answer the questions in your own words, honestly and truthfully. We expect each student will answer these questions differently! Finishing Up When your homework is complete, you should save your work and commit the changes to Github so that your professor can grade it. When you are confident the program is correct you are finished writing the program. Save your changes and exit Jupyter notebook. Add your change to your local git repository. Commit your change with the message \u201cCompleted NYC 1 walkthough\u201d Push your code to Github. Wait a minute, then verify your code, including proof it was executed via the program output is on the Github website.

This is the preferred development environment of Scientists, Data Analysts, and of course Data Scientists. The notebook environment is beneficial to these disciplines because you can combine instructions with code and intermix visualizations such as tables, map and graphs. Jupyter runs as a mini web server within the Azure Notebooks environment thus all you\u2019ll need to write and run your code is a web browser. Log on to Azure Notebooks: https://notebooks.azure.com with your SU email and NetID password. From the Azure Notebooks home page select the IST256 project. From the IST256 project page, click the run button (It will probably say \u201cRun on free Compute\u201d). This will launch the Jupyter Notebooks environment. You can tell the environment has launched as you will see \u201cPowered by jupyter\u201d at the top of the page. Next, we have to navigate to our code. We\u2019re in Lesson 01, so we have to find that folder: Click on your Git repository folder. Click on the content folder. Click on the lessons folder. Click on the 01 folder. You should now see the folders pertinent to this lesson: NOTE: There are typically 4 folders per lesson, defined as follows: Watch-Me-Code This folder contains the code demos as part of lecture day. End-To-End-Example This folder contains the end to end examples as part of lecture day. Class-Coding-Lab This folder contains the class coding lab and supporting files. Now-You-Code This folder contains the homework exercises. One will be worked on during recitation, the other must be finished by the end of the week. The code we will write is in the Class-Coding-Lab folder. Double-click on that folder. You should see the file: Files ending with .ipynb are Jupyter Notebook files. Double-click on CCL-walkthrough.ipynb to open the notebook file. Notice this opens a new Tab in your browser window: Let\u2019s write some code! Click on empty cell beneath the text. It should now be outlined in GREEN. Type the following code in the cell: print(\"Hello, Python!\") your screen should look like this: To execute the code from the current cell, press Shift+Enter or press the play button beneath the menu item named \u201cCell\u201d. The code in the cell will execute, and underneath it you will see the output: Jupyter then places you in a new cell where you can write additional code. NOTE: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell that you can find by exploring\u2026 The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a modal editing system. This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard depends on which mode you are in. The two modes are: Edit mode: Indicated by a green border around one cell. Whatever you type appears as is in that cell. This is how you code. Command mode: The green border is replaced by a Blue and grey border. Key strokes are interpreted as commands \u2014 for example, typing l toggles line numbers. To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the Esc keyboard To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit Enter or click in a cell The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it. In this screenshot, I\u2019ve toggle line numbers on for cell with code in it: PRO TIP: Need a list of commands? Open the command pallette from the toolbar. It lists all the available commands! What key do you press to save the notebook? Press it now! Next, Let\u2019s paste in some sample code which really shows off the power of Jupyter notebook. This code, taken from http://matplotlib.org/1.4.1/examples/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar_demo.html will generate a polar chart of random data. Copy and paste the following code into the cell beneath your Hello, Python! program: %matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 20 theta = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False) radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N) width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N) ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True) bars = ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) for r, bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor(plt.cm.jet(r / 10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) plt.show() Don\u2019t worry about what this code is doing right now. You\u2019ll learn to understand it in time! When you paste and execute the code you should see this: NOTE: The chart will be different each time it runs as its based on random data. In this final coding step, we will write code to test your Python setup. Type the following code into a new cell below your chart: We gave you a screen shot of the code this time to force you to type it in! Practice makes perfect! If the code executes correctly, you should see the message This is Working in the program output. Working will be colored green, like this: HELP I GOT ERRORS!!! If you get an ImportError then you will need to go to another cell and import the missing module. For example, if you are missing matplotlib in the cell you would type: !pip3 install --user matplotlib to add the missing bits to Python. Yes there\u2019s a ! character in frot of the command.

Those changes are saved in Azure Notebooks, but how do we share them with our Professor? We\u2019ll walk-through this process next. From the terminal you opened in the previous step: We\u2019ve made some changes, let\u2019s see what git has to say about them. Type: git status to check the state of our repository. The output should look something like this: Git tells us we have changes which are not staged for commit . This means we\u2019ve made changes and git doesn\u2019t know about them yet. You must tell git which changes to files you want to commit. This is called staging the commit. Let\u2019s tell git to stage all the changed files in the repository folder. Type: git add --all 99% of the time this is what we want. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository now that we\u2019ve staged our files. Type: git status again to see what\u2019s happening in our repository. Now git tells us the files we\u2019ve changed are now ready to be committed . Let\u2019s commit the changes to git. What does this mean exactly? Git Commit Explained: When you commit files, you\u2019re saving the history of them to git repository. It\u2019s like taking a snapshot of your repository folders\u2019 contents at that point in time. Because you have this snapshot you are able to revert the files back to this point whenever you desire. As you can imagine, this is an extremely useful feature for programming teams who are making changes (good and bad) to their code. Think of the commit as an insurance policy: You hope you never need to use it, but it\u2019s there for you just in case you do ! Whenever we commit we should should add a message: something to remind us of the changes we\u2019ve made. This is helpful in the event you need to cash in on that insurance policy! Enough talk. Time to commit our changes. Type: git commit -m \"Completed programming walk through lab\" NOTE: The -m represents the message part of the commit. The output says there we 1 files changed, and 56 insertions, meaning we added 56 lines of code since the last commit. Yes, git makes managing your team easy because it tracks not only who worked on what but also quantifies their contributions . Your information may vary slightly, of course. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository files now. Type: git status Now our local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit. This tells us our local git repository is newer than our remote copy on GitHub. We also have nothing to commit meaning our files are in sync with our local copy of git. This makes sense: we just committed! The last step in the process is to sync up our local copy of git commits with on GitHub. Before we do that let\u2019s explain the process. The status message says Your branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit . What exactly does this mean? Well, when we initially cloned the repository off GitHub, it made two versions of the repository. One is still on GitHub (git calls this one \u2018origin/master\u2019 ) the other is on your computer. When the two repositories get out-of-sync, we can reconcile them in two ways: When the the local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a push to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the local commits remotely on GitHub. When the the local branch is behind \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a pull to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the commits on GitHub in our local repository. Since we\u2019re ahead we should push . Type: git push origin master You should see output similar to the following: (again your message might be different depending on what was changed) An one final check of the repository status: Type: git status Which is the same status from the beginning of the walk-through! It tells us nothing has changed locally and what we have here is now in sync with GitHub. IMPORTANT: You\u2019ll execute step 2.3 every time you code . You should get in the habit of following this procedure after each coding session. Class is over? commit code and push to GitHub. Work on your homework for an hour? commit your code and push to GitHub. Not only will it record your changes for you in the event you need to undo a change , but it also backs up your work to the cloud in the event that work has a problem or becomes lost / broken! It\u2019s great insurance against disasters and its so, so easy to do . You can push the same assignment multiple times.

This is an essential and often overlooked aspect of computer programming. Programming provides vast resources at your disposal, but unless you can combine them into a coherent solution they are not much use. A good way to analyze a programming problem is with the input-process-output model. In this model we identify the inputs into the program, the expected outputs based on those inputs and then we write down the steps (the algorithm) to get from input to output. Your algorithm, or steps should NOT be in any programming language. They should be written as atomic steps in a natural language. To become a good algorithm writer takes practice. It seems foreign at first but like anything the more you do it the more natural it becomes.

For this course you will need to install the following applications: Python 3.6.6 A bunch of Python Modules Git 2.18 Each of these applications are free / open-source and will not cost you any money. Detailed instructions for how to install these applications are provided below. Before You Begin Make sure you have at least 500MB (1/2 GB) free space on your computer. If you don\u2019t know how to check this, refer to these instructions: http://www.macworld.com/article/2972775/os-x/how-to-check-your-macs-free-hard-drive-space.html You must know how to create a folder. Don\u2019t know how to do this? Check out: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25633?locale=en_US You must know how to open up the command line / a terminal window on your Mac. It can be in any folder. Not sure how to do this? Consult this article: How Do I Open The Command Line? Make sure your computer is plugged in or fully charged and you have a good internet connection. Setup Procedure Step 0 : Folder and Command Line Create a folder called IST256 . You can make this folder where ever you want: on your desktop, in your Documents , etc\u2026 What\u2019s most important is to remember where it is and how to find it ! Open the command line on your computer inside this folder. For more info, read: How Do I Open The Command Line? Check yourself. From the command line, type: pwd and press the ENTER key. Does the Path have IST256 at the end? Then you are in the correct folder and may proceed! Automatic Setup Instructions Why not try the automated setup first? If it works for you, woot! From the command line, type: curl -o install.sh http://ist256.github.io/content/install/osx/install.txt && bash install.sh This will start the process of installing everything. This will take a few minutes to complete. NOTE: You may have to enter your administrator password. When the setup is complete, check the reported versions output by the setup script. They should be these version numbers at minimum: Python 3.6.6 Jupyter 5.5.0 Pip 18.1 Git 2.18.0 You can check these yourself if you like with these commands: python3 --version jupyter-notebook --version pip3 --version and git --version If everything reports correctly, complete the rest of the Course Setup Checklist Manual Setup Instructions ONLY DO THESE IF YOUR AUTOMATIC SETUP DOES NOT WORK! Step 1: Install Python First we will install Python. From the command line, type each of these and press ENTER to execute them: First we will download Python to our computer. Command to type: curl --remote-name https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.6/python-3.6.6-macosx10.9.pkg After the file is downloaded, we can install Python. Command to type: sudo installer -pkg python-3.6.6-macosx10.9.pkg -target / NOTE: You will need to type your admin password at the command prompt. The setup will take a minute or so. Be patient. When it is finished it will say: installer: The install was successful Execute the following command to setup the python environment: sh /Applications/Python\\ 3.6/Update\\ Shell\\ Profile.command Execute the following command to setup the python certificates: sh /Applications/Python\\ 3.6/Install\\ Certificates.command Close the command line window, then re-open the command line in your IST256 folder. This is an important step. Python will not work unless you do this! Make sure you\u2019re using the correct version. When you type: python3 --version it should say. Python 3.6.6 . Try out python to see if it works. Type this command. python3 -c \"print('YAY')\" If it works, you will see YAY in your terminal window. If so, it\u2019s time to move on to the next step. If you see errors, something went wrong with the previous steps. Step 2: Install Python modules Next we will install the common Python modules we will use in this course. This will save you a lot of time and headaches later on! First we will upgrade pip Python\u2019s package manager. From the command line, type: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip Next we install the Python JupyterLab environment we will use to write our code. pip3 install --upgrade ipython jupyter jupyterlab setuptools wheel This will take a while as it downloads these modules and their dependencies from the internet. Next we install more modules we will use in this course. Type: pip3 install -U geocoder lxml terminado numpy scipy requests Again, this might take a few minutes, so be patient. Finally, we install the last round of Python modules we will use in this course. Type: pip3 install -U pandas matplotlib plotly cufflinks folium bs4 And as usual it will take some time to install these modules. You can verify Jupyter is working by typing the following at the command line: jupyter-lab If it works, you will see Jupyter Lab open in your web browser. To exit Jupyter, close the browser, return to the command line and press CTRL+C two times. Close the terminal window. Step 3: Install the git utility. First we will download Python to our computer. Command to type: curl -o git-2.18.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg -L https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.18.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect -O After the download we can mount the image: hdiutil attach git-2.18.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg After the mount completes, we can install Git.

They should be at least these versions: Python 3.6.6 Jupyter 5.5.0 Pip 18.1 Git 2.18.0 You can check these yourself if you like with these commands: python --version jupyter-notebook --version pip --version and git --version If everything reports correctly, complete the rest of the Course Setup Checklist Manual Setup Instructions ONLY DO THESE IF YOUR AUTOMATIC SETUP DOES NOT WORK! Step 1: Install Python First we will install Python. From the command line, type each of these and press ENTER to execute them: First we need to update PowerShell to use the latest SSL protocol. Type: [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Now we will download Python to our computer. Command to type: wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.6/python-3.6.6-amd64.exe -OutFile python-3.6.6-amd64.exe After the file is downloaded, we can install Python. Command to type: .\\python-3.6.6-amd64.exe /passive InstallAllUsers=0 PrependPath=1 SimpleInstall=1 The setup will take a minute or so. Be patient. Close the command line window, then re-open the command line in your IST256 folder. This is an important step. Python will not work unless you do this! Try out python to see if it works. Type this command. python -c \"print('YAY')\" If it works, you will see YAY in your terminal window. If so, it\u2019s time to move on to the next step. If you see errors, something went wrong with the previous steps. Step 2: Install Python modules Next we will install the common Python components we will use in this course. This will save you a lot of time and headaches later on! First we will upgrade pip Python\u2019s package manager. From the command line, type: python -m pip install --upgrade pip Next we install the Python JupyterLab environment we will use to write our code. pip install --upgrade ipython jupyter jupyterlab setuptools wheel This will take a while as it downloads these modules and their dependencies from the internet. Next we install more modules we will use in this course. Type: pip install -U geocoder lxml terminado numpy scipy requests Again, this might take a few minutes, so be patient. Finally, we install the last round of Python modules we will use in this course. Type: pip install -U pandas matplotlib plotly cufflinks folium bs4 And as usual it will take some time to install these modules. You can verify Jupyter is working by typing the following at the command line: jupyter-lab If it works, you will see Jupyter Lab open in your web browser. To exit Jupyter, close the browser, return to the command line and press CTRL+C two times. Close the terminal window. Step 3: Install the git utility. Again, first we need to update PowerShell to use the latest SSL protocol. Type: [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 First we will download Git to our computer. Command to type: wget https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.18.0.windows.1/Git-2.18.0-64-bit.exe -OutFile git-2.18.0-64-bit.exe After the file is downloaded, we can install Git. Command to type: ./git-2.18.0-64-bit.exe /SILENT The setup will take a minute or so. Be patient. Close the command line window, then re-open the command line in your IST256 folder. This is an important step. Python will not work unless you do this! Try out python to see if it works. Type this command. git --version If it works, you will see 2.18 in your terminal window as the Git version.

Part 1: Overview Becoming a Modern programmer Programming is more than just writing code and solving problems. Modern programming is a collaborative activity. For instance, so many people contribute code to the Linux kernel, the number of contributors is too high to count ! This is why one of the learning objectives of this course is to: \"Understand how to code in teams, collaborate with others and manage source code.\" To do that we need to learn and use the same tools and techniques that actual programmers use. It\u2019s going to steepen our learning curve a bit, but trust us when we say it\u2019s worth it! Remember. Today\u2019s programmers: Use the command line to operate their computer. Use git (or some other source code manager) manage their code. Write code that is easily understood by others Can explain their code to others (including non-programmers) You\u2019ll do each of these, many times throughout this course. You\u2019ll start some of them RIGHT NOW! Goals of this walk-through The goal of this exercise is to get you acquainted with the process of \u201chow we will code\u201d in this class. It DOES NOT focus at all on programming itself. In fact all the code will be written for you. Instead we will focus on the PROCESS of coding. We will cover the tools you will use throughout the course such as the command line / terminal , git , GitHub , and Jupyter Notebook to write our programs, execute them, then commit your work so your others can view it. Upon the completion of this walk-through you should be able to: Locate your Learn-Python code repository on your computer and open the command line in the repository folder. Use Python\u2019s Jupyter Notebook environment. Write and execute a simple Python program. Use git to commit your code changes and push them over the Internet to GitHub. View your code changes on the GitHub website. After you complete this walk-through you should have a good idea how to work on your code in-class and save your work to GitHub. Before You Begin Before you complete this walk-through you should need to make sure you\u2019ve completed the course setup checklist . You cannot complete this walk-through without it! If for some reason you\u2019ve haven\u2019t completed the course setup checklist (ahem\u2026 shame on you!) then you should do so NOW. NOTE: You cannot complete the lab or homework without first following the course setup checklist to set up your laptop. Part 2: The Programming Process [L01] In this part we will guide you through the programming process step-by-step. When you are finished with the process you will have completed your first lab, L01, and handed it in to Github for a grade! In this walk-through we will simulate your typical workflow when working on labs, recitations, or homework assignments in this course. Specifically we will: Open, Edit, and Execute a Python program using Jupyter Notebook Open the command line in our Learn-Python git repository Save our code changes to git , then push them to GitHub View our saved code locally and on the GitHub website. Step 2.1: Open, Edit, and Execute a Python program using Jupyter Notebook The primary tool we will use to program in Python is called Jupyter Notebook . This is the preferred development environment of Scientists, Data Analysts, and of course Data Scientists. The notebook environment is beneficial to these disciplines because you can combine instructions with code and intermix visualizations such as tables, map and graphs. Jupyter runs as a mini web server within the Azure Notebooks environment thus all you\u2019ll need to write and run your code is a web browser. Log on to Azure Notebooks: https://notebooks.azure.com with your SU email and NetID password. From the Azure Notebooks home page select the IST256 project. From the IST256 project page, click the run button (It will probably say \u201cRun on free Compute\u201d). This will launch the Jupyter Notebooks environment. You can tell the environment has launched as you will see \u201cPowered by jupyter\u201d at the top of the page. Next, we have to navigate to our code. We\u2019re in Lesson 01, so we have to find that folder: Click on your Git repository folder. Click on the content folder. Click on the lessons folder. Click on the 01 folder. You should now see the folders pertinent to this lesson: NOTE: There are typically 4 folders per lesson, defined as follows: Watch-Me-Code This folder contains the code demos as part of lecture day. End-To-End-Example This folder contains the end to end examples as part of lecture day. Class-Coding-Lab This folder contains the class coding lab and supporting files. Now-You-Code This folder contains the homework exercises. One will be worked on during recitation, the other must be finished by the end of the week. The code we will write is in the Class-Coding-Lab folder. Double-click on that folder. You should see the file: Files ending with .ipynb are Jupyter Notebook files. Double-click on CCL-walkthrough.ipynb to open the notebook file. Notice this opens a new Tab in your browser window: Let\u2019s write some code! Click on empty cell beneath the text. It should now be outlined in GREEN. Type the following code in the cell: print(\"Hello, Python!\") your screen should look like this: To execute the code from the current cell, press Shift+Enter or press the play button beneath the menu item named \u201cCell\u201d. The code in the cell will execute, and underneath it you will see the output: Jupyter then places you in a new cell where you can write additional code. NOTE: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell that you can find by exploring\u2026 The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a modal editing system. This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard depends on which mode you are in. The two modes are: Edit mode: Indicated by a green border around one cell. Whatever you type appears as is in that cell. This is how you code. Command mode: The green border is replaced by a Blue and grey border. Key strokes are interpreted as commands \u2014 for example, typing l toggles line numbers. To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the Esc keyboard To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit Enter or click in a cell The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it. In this screenshot, I\u2019ve toggle line numbers on for cell with code in it: PRO TIP: Need a list of commands? Open the command pallette from the toolbar. It lists all the available commands! What key do you press to save the notebook? Press it now! Next, Let\u2019s paste in some sample code which really shows off the power of Jupyter notebook. This code, taken from http://matplotlib.org/1.4.1/examples/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar_demo.html will generate a polar chart of random data. Copy and paste the following code into the cell beneath your Hello, Python! program: %matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 20 theta = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False) radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N) width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N) ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True) bars = ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) for r, bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor(plt.cm.jet(r / 10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) plt.show() Don\u2019t worry about what this code is doing right now. You\u2019ll learn to understand it in time! When you paste and execute the code you should see this: NOTE: The chart will be different each time it runs as its based on random data. In this final coding step, we will write code to test your Python setup. Type the following code into a new cell below your chart: We gave you a screen shot of the code this time to force you to type it in! Practice makes perfect! If the code executes correctly, you should see the message This is Working in the program output. Working will be colored green, like this: HELP I GOT ERRORS!!! If you get an ImportError then you will need to go to another cell and import the missing module. For example, if you are missing matplotlib in the cell you would type: !pip3 install --user matplotlib to add the missing bits to Python. Yes there\u2019s a ! character in frot of the command. This instructs Jupyter notebook to drop down to the command line. Exiting Your Jupyter Notebook File So you are done with your Jupyter notebook file, so how do we save and close out? Save your work. Enter command mode and press s to save. Exit the notebook page. From the Jupyter menu select File then Close and Halt : NOTE: It is important to exit the notebook file this way or else it will continue to run in the background. This will slow down other notebooks you attempt to run! Step 2.2: Opening the command line in your Learn-Python git repository. You will need to commit your code changes and send them to GitHub for grading. In order to do this, you must open up the command line (linux terminal) in your git repository folder. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS IN YOUR SLEEP WITH HANDS TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK. From the Azure Notebook homepage https://notebooks.azure.com , select the IST256 project from the My Projects workspace. Click the Terminal icon to launch the terminal. This will give you access to the command line. When the terminal launches you should see a command line with the prompt nbuser@nbserver:~$ Switch the current working directory to the library folder by typing: cd ~/library Your command prompt should now read: nbuser@nbserver:~/library$ Next you need to switch into the local copy of your Git reposiotry folder. This will likely begin with the year and semester you\u2019re taking the course e.g. 2019-fall-learn-python-mafudge-su . For example, I would type: cd 2019-fall-learn-python-mafudge-su . The easiest way to find your folder is to type: cd then type the year you\u2019re taking the course, then press the TAB key and the teriminal will complete the rest for you! Verify you are in the correct folder by typing: git status * If you are in the correct folder, you should see on branch master in the first part of the command output. * If you are NOT in the correct folder, you will see fatal: not a git repository in the first part of the command output. Step 2.3: Save our code changes to git , then push them to GitHub During this walk-through we\u2019ve made changes to the file: CCL-walkthrough.ipynb . Those changes are saved in Azure Notebooks, but how do we share them with our Professor? We\u2019ll walk-through this process next. From the terminal you opened in the previous step: We\u2019ve made some changes, let\u2019s see what git has to say about them. Type: git status to check the state of our repository. The output should look something like this: Git tells us we have changes which are not staged for commit . This means we\u2019ve made changes and git doesn\u2019t know about them yet. You must tell git which changes to files you want to commit. This is called staging the commit. Let\u2019s tell git to stage all the changed files in the repository folder. Type: git add --all 99% of the time this is what we want. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository now that we\u2019ve staged our files. Type: git status again to see what\u2019s happening in our repository. Now git tells us the files we\u2019ve changed are now ready to be committed . Let\u2019s commit the changes to git. What does this mean exactly? Git Commit Explained: When you commit files, you\u2019re saving the history of them to git repository. It\u2019s like taking a snapshot of your repository folders\u2019 contents at that point in time. Because you have this snapshot you are able to revert the files back to this point whenever you desire. As you can imagine, this is an extremely useful feature for programming teams who are making changes (good and bad) to their code. Think of the commit as an insurance policy: You hope you never need to use it, but it\u2019s there for you just in case you do ! Whenever we commit we should should add a message: something to remind us of the changes we\u2019ve made. This is helpful in the event you need to cash in on that insurance policy! Enough talk. Time to commit our changes. Type: git commit -m \"Completed programming walk through lab\" NOTE: The -m represents the message part of the commit. The output says there we 1 files changed, and 56 insertions, meaning we added 56 lines of code since the last commit. Yes, git makes managing your team easy because it tracks not only who worked on what but also quantifies their contributions . Your information may vary slightly, of course. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository files now. Type: git status Now our local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit. This tells us our local git repository is newer than our remote copy on GitHub. We also have nothing to commit meaning our files are in sync with our local copy of git. This makes sense: we just committed! The last step in the process is to sync up our local copy of git commits with on GitHub. Before we do that let\u2019s explain the process. The status message says Your branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit . What exactly does this mean? Well, when we initially cloned the repository off GitHub, it made two versions of the repository. One is still on GitHub (git calls this one \u2018origin/master\u2019 ) the other is on your computer. When the two repositories get out-of-sync, we can reconcile them in two ways: When the the local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a push to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the local commits remotely on GitHub. When the the local branch is behind \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a pull to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the commits on GitHub in our local repository. Since we\u2019re ahead we should push .

It tells us nothing has changed locally and what we have here is now in sync with GitHub. IMPORTANT: You\u2019ll execute step 2.3 every time you code . You should get in the habit of following this procedure after each coding session. Class is over? commit code and push to GitHub.

Step 2.4: Visualizing your commits on GitHub Once you get rolling with a few commits it might be useful to look back at the history of changes you\u2019ve made. Let\u2019s demonstrate that locally and on GitHub. Open your repository website on https://github.com . If you don\u2019t remember what it is from the command line in your local repository type: git remote -v to display it. From the GitHub repository Website, select commits From the commits page, select the commit for which you would like to view the changes In this example you want to select the commit with message Completed programming walk through lab You will then see a web of all the files changed in that commit. In this example we should see the file CCL-walkthrough.ipynb . On the left is the file before the commit On the right is the file after the commit Github uses the familiar red/green and + / - syntax as gitk Part 3: On Your Own [H01] Next, we will walk you through a typical homework assignment. Since we\u2019ve focused on committing work to with git already, in this part we will emphasize how go about completing homework. Similar to the labs, the homework assignments can be found in your git repository folder and you code the solution in Jupyter notebook. Getting Started Open the following file in Jupyter Notebook: lessons/01/Now-You-Code/NYC1-walkthrough.ipynb This homework assignment is similar to all the others. It consists of several sections: problem definition, problem analysis, section to write code, and some questions which encourage you to think laterally. Each of these sections should be completed before you hand in a homework assignment. At the bottom of the homework is a reminder of how the homework is evaluated. Use this to make sure you\u2019re achieving the highest grade possible for your efforts. Step 1: Problem Analysis Before we can solve a problem with computer code, we must first understand the problem itself . This is an essential and often overlooked aspect of computer programming. Programming provides vast resources at your disposal, but unless you can combine them into a coherent solution they are not much use. A good way to analyze a programming problem is with the input-process-output model. In this model we identify the inputs into the program, the expected outputs based on those inputs and then we write down the steps (the algorithm) to get from input to output. Your algorithm, or steps should NOT be in any programming language. They should be written as atomic steps in a natural language. To become a good algorithm writer takes practice. It seems foreign at first but like anything the more you do it the more natural it becomes. Let\u2019s complete the problem analysis section together: Double click on the Problem analysis section to edit the markdown. When you\u2019re in edit mode it looks like this: Add the following to the markdown, outlining the inputs, output, and process for this program. Again, this is a common problem solving approach. When you are finished press SHIFT+ENTER to execute the cell and save your documentation. NOTE: For more complicated homeworks, you might spend an hour or so just thinking about your approach to the problem. I encourage you to do this \u201coff line.\u201d Most people are better problem solvers without the distractions of music, a computer, or background noise. Give yourself a chance in isolation to think about the problem deeply! You\u2019ll be surprised how productive it can be! Step 2: Write code Now that we\u2019ve outlined the problem and formally laid out a plan for writing the program, we can move on to writing our code. If you\u2019re doing it right, this step is merely taking each line in your algorithm and asking yourself, \u201cHow do I translate this into Python.\u201d When you\u2019re doing it wrong, such as coding without a problem analysis, then this step will be painfully frustrating. Let\u2019s complete the code section together: Next, move into the code cell: And write the Python program: print(\"Python Check Divider\") people = int(input(\"How many people are dining? \")) check_total = float(input(\"What is the total amount of the check? \")) contribution = check_total / people print(\"Each person should contribute\", contribution, \"dollars.\") When you are finished the cell should look like this: Press SHIFT+ENTER to execute the code. Try the same inputs as in the example run at the top. Do you get the same outputs? Execute the program a few more times, trying different inputs and verifying the outputs the program gives you match those you would expect. For example a $20 check split with 2 people should be $10 each. Is it? You\u2019ll have to \u201cplay computer\u201d and figure out the outputs yourself. This is a key activity of good programmers - never \u201cassume\u201d the computer code is correct, \u201cprove\u201d it\u2019s correct! In fact really good programmers write code to prove their code is correct, a process known as automated testing . NOTE: Usually, it will take you several iterations of the previous 2 steps before your program is \u201cdone\u201d. Why? Most problems are non-trivial and you are learning how to become a problem solver. Sometimes you won\u2019t know your original plan is crap until you write code and run it. DO NOT get discouraged by this! Each failure is a lesson which helps us become a better, more experienced programmer. In fact the end result of any working program Facebook to Angry Birds is the culmination of a mountain of failures, dead-ends, and small victories en-route to a feature-complete application. This is what makes programming so frustrating yet gratifying at the same time. Learn to embrace failure and work it to your advantage! Step 3: Questions After you\u2019ve completed the program you should answer the questions in the questions section. These are designed to \u201cget you thinking\u201d about the problem and test the flexibility of your solution. The questions usually focus on edge cases and potential pitfalls students may not have considered as they completed the homework. Completing them offers valuable insight into the program and ways to make it better. Many student go back and improve their program after answering the questions in an effort to score as high as possible on the homework. Edit the Questions cell and provide an answer to each question underneath the question itself. Since every student\u2019s answer will be different I did not include a screenshot this time. You may have to run the program to answer some of the questions. Make sure you click off the question cell and back into the code cell to run the program! NOTE: It is important to answer the questions in your own words, honestly and truthfully. We expect each student will answer these questions differently! Finishing Up When your homework is complete, you should save your work and commit the changes to Github so that your professor can grade it. When you are confident the program is correct you are finished writing the program. Save your changes and exit Jupyter notebook. Add your change to your local git repository. Commit your change with the message \u201cCompleted NYC 1 walkthough\u201d Push your code to Github. Wait a minute, then verify your code, including proof it was executed via the program output is on the Github website. At this point your homework has been turned in, and your professor should be able to grade it and determine whether you completed it on time, by checking the timestamp of your commit.","title":"Programming Walk-Through"},{"location":"images/walkthrough/#programming-walk-through","text":"There are activities in this walk-through which count towards your L01 (Lab) and H01 (Homework) grades this week, so pay very close attention!","title":"Programming Walk-Through"},{"location":"images/walkthrough/#part-1-overview","text":"","title":"Part 1: Overview"},{"location":"images/walkthrough/#becoming-a-modern-programmer","text":"Programming is more than just writing code and solving problems.

This is the preferred development environment of Scientists, Data Analysts, and of course Data Scientists. The notebook environment is beneficial to these disciplines because you can combine instructions with code and intermix visualizations such as tables, map and graphs. Jupyter runs as a mini web server within the Azure Notebooks environment thus all you\u2019ll need to write and run your code is a web browser. Log on to Azure Notebooks: https://notebooks.azure.com with your SU email and NetID password. From the Azure Notebooks home page select the IST256 project. From the IST256 project page, click the run button (It will probably say \u201cRun on free Compute\u201d). This will launch the Jupyter Notebooks environment. You can tell the environment has launched as you will see \u201cPowered by jupyter\u201d at the top of the page. Next, we have to navigate to our code. We\u2019re in Lesson 01, so we have to find that folder: Click on your Git repository folder. Click on the content folder. Click on the lessons folder. Click on the 01 folder. You should now see the folders pertinent to this lesson: NOTE: There are typically 4 folders per lesson, defined as follows: Watch-Me-Code This folder contains the code demos as part of lecture day. End-To-End-Example This folder contains the end to end examples as part of lecture day. Class-Coding-Lab This folder contains the class coding lab and supporting files. Now-You-Code This folder contains the homework exercises. One will be worked on during recitation, the other must be finished by the end of the week. The code we will write is in the Class-Coding-Lab folder. Double-click on that folder. You should see the file: Files ending with .ipynb are Jupyter Notebook files. Double-click on CCL-walkthrough.ipynb to open the notebook file. Notice this opens a new Tab in your browser window: Let\u2019s write some code! Click on empty cell beneath the text. It should now be outlined in GREEN. Type the following code in the cell: print(\"Hello, Python!\") your screen should look like this: To execute the code from the current cell, press Shift+Enter or press the play button beneath the menu item named \u201cCell\u201d. The code in the cell will execute, and underneath it you will see the output: Jupyter then places you in a new cell where you can write additional code. NOTE: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell that you can find by exploring\u2026 The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a modal editing system. This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard depends on which mode you are in. The two modes are: Edit mode: Indicated by a green border around one cell. Whatever you type appears as is in that cell. This is how you code. Command mode: The green border is replaced by a Blue and grey border. Key strokes are interpreted as commands \u2014 for example, typing l toggles line numbers. To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the Esc keyboard To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit Enter or click in a cell The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it. In this screenshot, I\u2019ve toggle line numbers on for cell with code in it: PRO TIP: Need a list of commands? Open the command pallette from the toolbar. It lists all the available commands! What key do you press to save the notebook? Press it now! Next, Let\u2019s paste in some sample code which really shows off the power of Jupyter notebook. This code, taken from http://matplotlib.org/1.4.1/examples/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar_demo.html will generate a polar chart of random data. Copy and paste the following code into the cell beneath your Hello, Python! program: %matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 20 theta = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False) radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N) width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N) ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True) bars = ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) for r, bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor(plt.cm.jet(r / 10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) plt.show() Don\u2019t worry about what this code is doing right now. You\u2019ll learn to understand it in time! When you paste and execute the code you should see this: NOTE: The chart will be different each time it runs as its based on random data. In this final coding step, we will write code to test your Python setup. Type the following code into a new cell below your chart: We gave you a screen shot of the code this time to force you to type it in! Practice makes perfect! If the code executes correctly, you should see the message This is Working in the program output. Working will be colored green, like this: HELP I GOT ERRORS!!! If you get an ImportError then you will need to go to another cell and import the missing module. For example, if you are missing matplotlib in the cell you would type: !pip3 install --user matplotlib to add the missing bits to Python. Yes there\u2019s a ! character in frot of the command.

Those changes are saved in Azure Notebooks, but how do we share them with our Professor? We\u2019ll walk-through this process next. From the terminal you opened in the previous step: We\u2019ve made some changes, let\u2019s see what git has to say about them. Type: git status to check the state of our repository. The output should look something like this: Git tells us we have changes which are not staged for commit . This means we\u2019ve made changes and git doesn\u2019t know about them yet. You must tell git which changes to files you want to commit. This is called staging the commit. Let\u2019s tell git to stage all the changed files in the repository folder. Type: git add --all 99% of the time this is what we want. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository now that we\u2019ve staged our files. Type: git status again to see what\u2019s happening in our repository. Now git tells us the files we\u2019ve changed are now ready to be committed . Let\u2019s commit the changes to git. What does this mean exactly? Git Commit Explained: When you commit files, you\u2019re saving the history of them to git repository. It\u2019s like taking a snapshot of your repository folders\u2019 contents at that point in time. Because you have this snapshot you are able to revert the files back to this point whenever you desire. As you can imagine, this is an extremely useful feature for programming teams who are making changes (good and bad) to their code. Think of the commit as an insurance policy: You hope you never need to use it, but it\u2019s there for you just in case you do ! Whenever we commit we should should add a message: something to remind us of the changes we\u2019ve made. This is helpful in the event you need to cash in on that insurance policy! Enough talk. Time to commit our changes. Type: git commit -m \"Completed programming walk through lab\" NOTE: The -m represents the message part of the commit. The output says there we 1 files changed, and 56 insertions, meaning we added 56 lines of code since the last commit. Yes, git makes managing your team easy because it tracks not only who worked on what but also quantifies their contributions . Your information may vary slightly, of course. Let\u2019s check the status of the repository files now. Type: git status Now our local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit. This tells us our local git repository is newer than our remote copy on GitHub. We also have nothing to commit meaning our files are in sync with our local copy of git. This makes sense: we just committed! The last step in the process is to sync up our local copy of git commits with on GitHub. Before we do that let\u2019s explain the process. The status message says Your branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 by 1 commit . What exactly does this mean? Well, when we initially cloned the repository off GitHub, it made two versions of the repository. One is still on GitHub (git calls this one \u2018origin/master\u2019 ) the other is on your computer. When the two repositories get out-of-sync, we can reconcile them in two ways: When the the local branch is ahead of \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a push to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the local commits remotely on GitHub. When the the local branch is behind \u2018origin/master\u2019 we need to execute a pull to synchronize the two repositories, re-playing the commits on GitHub in our local repository. Since we\u2019re ahead we should push . Type: git push origin master You should see output similar to the following: (again your message might be different depending on what was changed) An one final check of the repository status: Type: git status Which is the same status from the beginning of the walk-through! It tells us nothing has changed locally and what we have here is now in sync with GitHub. IMPORTANT: You\u2019ll execute step 2.3 every time you code . You should get in the habit of following this procedure after each coding session. Class is over? commit code and push to GitHub.
