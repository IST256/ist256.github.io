<h3 id="exams-e1-e4">Exams (E1 - E4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exams evaluate your recall and understanding of the course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations.  </li>
<li>There will be four exams in the course. Your best three exam scores count towards your final grade, offering you an opportunity to achieve mastery over the material.</li>
<li>You must attempt all 4 exams to qualify to have one of your exam scores dropped.</li>
<li>Due to the nature of the subject matter, examinations are naturally cumulative.</li>
<li>Exams dates are posted on the syllabus class schedule.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to be present for each exam on the date posted.</li>
<li>There are no re-issues or make-ups, as this is logistically difficult to accomplish fairly.</li>
<li>Exams are issued on paper as multiple choice. You may be asked to write a program by hand.</li>
<li>Exams are closed-book. You may not use notes, a computer or any aids (calculator, phone, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>Exam dates are posted on the course schedule.</li>
<li>All course content is considered for exam questions. Assigned readings, Labs, Lectures, and Homework.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="specific-exam-policies">Specific Exam Policies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exam dates posted on the class schedule.</li>
<li>Exams are issued at the beginning of class and are 30 to 45 minutes long. If you show up late you will receive less time to complete the exam. If you show up after the exam completes, you&rsquo;ve missed the exam.</li>
<li>In general there are NO MAKE UP EXAMS without a university-approved reason such as illness or family emergencies. These must be documented by the university.</li>
<li>You may request to take the exam at another time. The request must be made at least 1 week in advance of the exam date. You must have a legitimate reason for this request AND prof. Fudge must approve it. If your exam is approved you will suffer a 50% penalty for not taking the exam on the scheduled date. This is out of inconvenience of scheduling a proctor for the exam.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-p1-p4">Project (P1 - P4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability to program something novel, useful and innovative in Python.</li>
<li>The project is divided into 4 phases; due dates are posted on the course schedule. Late submissions are accepted but will receive a grade of zero.</li>
<li>The project is a group assignment, teams of no more than 3 people.</li>
<li>Details for the project can be found under the <a href="/project">Project</a> heading on the course website.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Zybook <a href="https://learn.zybooks.com/">https://learn.zybooks.com/</a> interactive textbook is an excellent resource for learning Python. As such, your use of this resource will be graded.</li>
<li>For most lessons, relevant Zybook chapters are assigned on the <a href="#course-schedule">course schedule</a>.</li>
<li>For each assigned chapter, you are expected to complete the reading and participation activities by 3PM Monday.</li>
<li>The Zybook website records your interactions so it is trivial to see how much of the chapter you have completed.</li>
<li>Only the readings and <strong>participation activities</strong> are graded. The challenge activities and labs are optional.</li>

<li>This activity must be completed and turned in between the lecture and recitation sections. It will be discussed in the recitation.</li>
<li>You may work alone, but it is not frowned upon to work alongside a partner as you complete the lab. If you work with another, you should both complete the lab individually, and you should make a note of who your lab partner was when you completed your work.</li>
<li>You are awarded up to 5 points for the lab.</li>
<li>If you are not in attendance at recitation you will not receive full credit for the class coding lab. Students are expected to be present and capable of discussing their lab in recitation.</li>
<li>It is not as important to get the lab correct as it is to ask questions about that which you do not understand about the lab and bring those questions to recitation.  </li>
<li>You are given one &ldquo;Free Pass&rdquo;, meaning you have one incomplete lab without penalty.  </li>

<h3 id="course-honor-code">Course Honor Code</h3>
<p>The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All work is my own</strong>. Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, homework, problem sets, projects, papers, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly permitted). In the case where collaboration is permitted I will only collaborate within my team.</li>
<li><strong>I will not share answers.</strong> I will not make answers (either my own or the professor’s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web or sharing them in test banks.</li>
<li><strong>I will not misrepresent my ability.</strong> I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids and copying homework.</li>
<li><strong>I will give credit.</strong> I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the web, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper.</li>
<li><strong>I accept the honor code and its consequences.</strong> I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University&rsquo;s office of Academic Integrity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sanctions-for-violations-of-academic-integrity">Sanctions for Violations of Academic Integrity</h3>
<ul>
<li>All suspected academic integrity violations will be reported to the university&rsquo;s office of academic integrity.</li>
<li>Sanctions for violations on homework assignments or labs, is a grade of zero.</li>
<li>Sanctions for violations on an exam or the final project are F in the course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="effort-class-participation-and-attendance">Effort, Class Participation and Attendance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance, class participation and your overall effort may factor into your final grade.</li>
<li>While these factors are not actively graded, they are monitored. We notice students who are attending, being helpful to others, putting in effort, actively participating and those who do not. </li>
<li>The course instructors have a final say as to whether your final grade will be altered based on your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Students with exemplary effort, attendance or participation may be moved UP one letter grade.</strong>  For example if you finish with a 565/600 or an A- you might be moved up to an A. Reasons for being moved up are solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. Examples include but are not limited to: perfect attendance, noticeable improvement in grades throughout the semester, being a good mentor / coach to other students by helping in recitations and answering student questions on gitter. </li>
<li><strong>Students with poor effort, attendance or participation may be moved DOWN one letter grade.</strong> For example if you finish with a 565/600, or an A-, you might be moved down to a B+. Reasons for being moved down is usually poor attendance (3 or more absences in the semester), but is not limited to only attendance. </li>
<li>If your final grade is adjusted UP or DOWN, you will receive a written notification of justification from an instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Requests to have your grade adjusted will be ignored. Please let your actions speak for themselves.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syracuse-university-policies">Syracuse University Policies</h2>
<p>Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversity and Disability</strong> (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/">https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/</a></li>
<li><strong>Religious Observances Notification and Policy</strong> (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: <a href="http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm">http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm</a></li>
<li><strong>Orange SUccess</strong> (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disability-related-accommodations">Disability-Related Accommodations</h3>
<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in this process.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their website at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">http://disabilityservices.syr.edu</a> Please call (315) 443-4498 or email <a href="mailto:disabilityservices@syr.edu">disabilityservices@syr.edu</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible to begin this process.</p>
<h3 id="university-attendance-policy">University Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.</p>
<p>It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in
Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More
information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a> Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.</p>
<h3 id="discrimination-or-harassment">Discrimination or Harassment</h3>
<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.</p>
<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
