# Setup Your Gitter.im Account

Gitter.im is a chat service where programmers go to talk about their code projects. In this course we will use Gitter.im to discuss the course and ask questions about Python code. We want to break down the traditional teacher-student exchange and create a community where both teachers and students ask and answer questions. We will encourage you to contact us via Gitter instead of using traditional tools like email.
