<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
<p>Office hours are for asking questions, clearing up doubts and misunderstandings in the the coursework and getting advice / guidance on labs and homework. Please to not expect to be tutored during office hours, and please do not work on your homework during our office hours. Each of your instructor&rsquo;s Office Hours will be posted in Blackboard. If you require tutoring, please see the getting help section below.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-approach-used-in-this-course">Understanding Approach Used in this Course</h2>
<p>Learning to program a computer does not come easy for most people. Decades of teaching programming to students like yourself has taught me it requires time, patience, practice and a well-established routine.  This is not unlike the same routine required to learn a foreign language or musical instrument. There are times to practice and then times to demonstrate what you have learned.  </p>
<h3 id="forced-practice">Forced Practice</h3>
<p>For better or worse, this course grading is designed to force you to practice. There are various activities due each week: readings, labs, and in-class / out-of-class homework activities. These are designed to expose you to programming little each day rather than binging the content once a week. Consuming the material this way gives you multiple points of exposure and most importantly time to process. Practice activities are effort graded. This means being correct carries the same weight as explaining your struggles when you know you are not correct and seeking help when you need it.  </p>
<h3 id="building-habit-through-routine">Building Habit Through Routine</h3>
<p>Another thing we do to help you to be successful is to force a routine upon you. The course material is conceptually difficult so we try to remove some of the logistics from learning by providing the same structure week to week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before LARGE GROUP lecture you are exposed to the topic through reading. The focus is on understanding the concepts.</li>
<li>During LARGE GROUP lecture you observe and ask questions. Students do not write code at this  point. The focus is on reading code, understanding the concepts as applied through code, and learning how the code executes.</li>
<li>The LAB assignments force you to practice writing code for the first time. This is done in a guided fashion. You are given short, specific problems to solve with code. Guidance is provided to those who require it.  The completed lab is submitted as evidence that you practiced and include what you have learned.  </li>
<li>During the SMALL GROUP lecture, we focus on problem solving and writing solutions with code. The problem at this phase are similar complexity as the homework. At this point every student should be writing code, learning to get comfortable writing code and troubleshooting problems. Code written in small group must be turned in for a participation grade.</li>
<li>Finally, the HOMEWORK assignments are your opportunity to demonstrate you can code a solution to a problem on your own. Guidance is provided as to how to approach the problem. Homework assignments are a form of practice so it is expected students will explain what they learned or are still struggling to conceptualize. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assessments">Assessments</h3>
<p>Assessments are no longer about practice. They are about demonstrating what you have learned. There are two types of assessments in this course EXAMS and a PROJECT. There are exams at quarterly milestones throughout the course and in the sprit of mastery, the lowest exam score is dropped. The project demonstrates you can learn to code independently, then explain your solution to another. </p>
<h3 id="large-session-expectations">Large Session Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Monday&rsquo;s Large group session, section M001 in a large lecture hall. Because it can be intimidating to ask questions in this forum, you are encouraged to use the class chat offered for this course. The first slide at the beginning of large group will explain how to access the class chat. You are welcome, and encouraged to ask questions or for clarification of concepts during the lecture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to engage in class by participating in class-wide polls, quizzes and surveys. Your responses are not graded but they are recorded as a means to measure your participation and engagement in class.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do NOT try to code as I code. Instead, watch and ask questions about what you see and experience. It&rsquo;s far too early for most learners to try and code as I code at this point, and there will be opportunities to do that in small group. Instead you should take nodes and ask questions. Except for the homework solution, the code I write will be made available to you after class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="small-group-expectations">Small Group Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small group sessions meet with a fraction of the class. Here you will practice programming and algorithmic problem solving.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are expected to bring your fully-charged laptop to class! You will need to use it to complete in-class exercises. If you do not have your laptop, then you are not prepared for class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to participate in class. This includes sharing your thoughts, ideas, and computer code when you are asked. Some of you might be hesitant to do this, but you need to get over it for your own benefit. Nobody starts out programming as an expert. It takes practice, experimentation, and repeated failure to get it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be respectful of your instructor and classmates. You are not competing against each other, you are a community. Not everyone learns at the same pace and we should be kind and respectful to our classmates who struggle.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="exams-e1-e4">Exams (E1 - E4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exams are high-stakes assessments. They measure the individual&rsquo;s ability to recall, understand, and apply the course material. They are one of two instruments in this course which measures your mastery of the learning outcomes.</li>
<li>There will be four exams in the course. Your best three scores count towards your final grade, offering you an opportunity to achieve mastery over the material, should you perform poorly on one.</li>
<li>Each exam focuses on specific lessons, but due to the nature of the course material, all exams are cumulative.</li>
<li>Exams are issued online via blackboard.</li>
<li>You may take the exam anytime and from anywhere on the exam date.</li>
<li>Once you start the exam you must complete it in a single session.</li>
<li>You get one exam attempt. Do not start until you are ready to take the exam.</li>
<li>Exams are timed at 15 minutes and will auto-submit when time is up.</li>
<li>Questions consist of multiple choice, and fill-in-the blank.</li>
<li>Questions are delivered at random from a pool of questions, one question at a time. This is to mitigate cheating on the exam and copying of code into Python.</li>
<li>Since everyone has a 24 hour window to complete the exam, there are no re-issues or make-ups.</li>
<li>To prevent building of test banks, answers to the exams will not be released. You may ask in office hours to see your exam.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-p1-p4">Project (P1 - P4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The project is the other high-stakes assessment. The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability as an individual to program something novel, useful and innovative in Python. It should represent an accurate culmination of what you have learned in the course.</li>
<li>You will work on the project individually, be expected to produce working code, and be able to explain it at both a high and detailed level.</li>
<li>The project is divided into 4 phases; due dates are posted on the course schedule.</li>
<li>You will receive feedback and advice after the first two deliverables; a project grade after the final deliverable.</li>
<li>Each project phase must be submitted on Jupyterhub using the provided submission notebook.</li>
<li>Late submissions are accepted but will impact your project grade severely.</li>

<ul>
<li>Each week there will be an out-of-class hands-on lab programming activity.</li>
<li>The purpose of the lab is to provide guided, hands-on programming practice. Labs are your first opportunity to get your hands on a keyboard and start programming. This is a low-stakes assessment, mostly participatory. </li>
<li>The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the lab you should complete.</li>
<li>You can find the lab activity on JupyterHub.</li>
<li>This activity must be completed and turned submitted by the due date.</li>
<li>You may work alone or with a partner as you complete the lab. If you work with another, you should both complete the lab individually, and you should make a note of who your lab partner was when you completed your work. As to not draw attention to a potential academic integrity violation.</li>
<li>If you are having difficulty completing the lab, you are welcome to review the walk-through video which guides you through the more difficult parts of the lab. You are encouraged to only consult the walk-through when you are stuck.</li>

<h3 id="homework-h01-h13">Homework (H01 - H13)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practice makes perfect. Each week you will be assigned homework to complete outside of class.</li>
<li>The goal of the homework is practice problem solving with code independently. Throughout the process you should take inventory of your abilities with respect to the material. While it is admirable to get the code correct, that is not the evaluation criteria nor is it the purpose of the homework. You should use the homework as a personal gauge for how well you are grasping the material.</li>
<li>You can find the the homework assignments on JupyterHub. The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the homework assignment you should complete.</li>
<li>Homework are <strong>individual assignments</strong>. You can collaborate on strategy but you must must work alone on the assignment.  You must be able to explain the code you write, or it will be considered an academic integrity violation. It&rsquo;s not about getting it right, but it is about making an honest self-assessment!</li>
<li>For each homework there is an advice video which provides hints and tips for how you can approach the homework assignment. You are encouraged to only consult the video when you are having difficulty with the homework.</li>
<li>If you get assistance from somewhere else, such as online, or someone else such as a tutor, you must divulge that in your submission or it will be considered an academic integrity violation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rubric-for-homework">Rubric for Homework</h4>
<p>Homework Criteria Definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code Correct</strong> means an honest attempt was made at a solution and the solution is correct. For incorrect solutions, the code runs, might not be correct, but there is some explanation in the reflection. </li>
<li><strong>Code Well Written</strong> means your code is easy to understand, modular in nature, has aptly named variables, was programmed in the style we learned in class, and demonstrates what you learned that week. </li>
<li><strong>Problem Analysis Complete</strong> problem analysis was complete, identifying the problem&rsquo;s inputs, outputs, and algorithm. An outline of the  step-by-step process for how the program should behave.</li>
<li><strong>Questions Complete</strong> means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection Complete</strong> means the student completed their code reflection, discussing their experiences with completing the assignment. This should provide insight as to how the work was done touching upon struggles, how you got it done, what was learned in the process.  </li>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>No extra credit is offered in this course.</p>
<h3 id="course-honor-code">Course Honor Code</h3>
<p>The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All work is my own</strong>. Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, homework, problem sets, projects, papers, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly permitted). In the case where collaboration is permitted I will only collaborate within my team.</li>
<li><strong>I will not share answers.</strong> I will not make answers (either my own or the professor’s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web or sharing them in test banks.</li>
<li><strong>I will not misrepresent my ability.</strong> I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids and copying homework.</li>
<li><strong>I will give credit.</strong> I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the web, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper.</li>
<li><strong>I accept the honor code and its consequences.</strong> I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University&rsquo;s office of Academic Integrity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sanctions-for-violations-of-academic-integrity">Sanctions for Violations of Academic Integrity</h3>
<ul>
<li>All suspected academic integrity violations will be reported to the university&rsquo;s office of academic integrity.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for violations of a low-stakes assessment such as a homework assignment or lab, is a grade of zero.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for violations on high-stakes assessment such as a quiz, exam or the final project is a grade of F in the course.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syracuse-university-policies">Syracuse University Policies</h2>
<p>Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concern:</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Disability</strong> (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and 
responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be
found here, at: <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/">https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Observances</strong> Notification and Policy (steps to follow to request
accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at:
<a href="http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm">http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm</a></p>

communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at:
<a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="disability-related-accommodations">Disability-Related Accommodations</h3>
<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the
Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. </p>
<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit
Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email <a href="disabilityresources@syr.edu">disabilityresources@syr.edu</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to begin this process. <a href="https://disabilityresources.syr.edu/">https://disabilityresources.syr.edu/</a></p>
<h3 id="university-attendance-policy">University Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.</p>
<p>It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in
Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More
information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a> Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about
course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits
students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and nongrade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. </p>
<h3 id="use-of-blackboard">Use of Blackboard</h3>
<p>This course involves the use of Syracuse University’s Blackboard system as an online tool. The environment is composed of a number of elements that will help you be successful in both your current coursework and your lifelong learning opportunities.
